# Environment Setup Guide

To ensure that the Employment Analysis and Recommendation System runs smoothly on your machine, it's essential to set up the Python environment correctly. This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to prepare your environment, including the installation of necessary Python packages and the configuration of additional tools.

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: The system is developed in Python. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Install Python and Pip
Ensure that Python and Pip are installed on your system. You can verify this by running:
```bash
python --version
pip --version
```
If these commands don't return version numbers, you will need to install Python from the official website. During installation, ensure that you check the option to add Python to your PATH.

### 2. Setup a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies. You can set up a virtual environment by running:
```bash
python -m venv myenv
```
To activate the virtual environment on Windows, use:
```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```
On macOS and Linux, use:
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Required Packages
Once your virtual environment is active, install the following packages using pip. These packages are necessary for running the scripts and the GUI application:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn xgboost jupyter tkinter requests beautifulsoup4 selenium
```

### 4. Understanding Python Imports
The project uses specific modules from the installed packages, typically imported using the `from ... import ...` statement. Here are some examples of how these are used in the scripts:
- ```python
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
  ```
  This is used for model training and hyperparameter tuning.
- ```python
  from xgboost import XGBRegressor
  ```
  This imports the XGBoost regression model.
- ```python
  from selenium import webdriver
  ```
  This is for controlling a web browser via Selenium.
- ```python
  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
  ```
  This is used for parsing HTML and XML documents.

These imports are crucial for the modular structure of the scripts, allowing specific functionalities to be used without loading entire libraries.

### 5. Configure API Access (If Required)
If you are using APIs, such as the BLS Public API, ensure you have the necessary API keys or access tokens configured within your scripts or stored securely.

### 6. Additional Notes
- Ensure that any paths to files within the scripts (e.g., CSV or JSON file paths) are updated to reflect their locations on your system.
- Verify that your internet connection allows for API calls and web scraping without interruption.

By following these steps, you should have a fully functional environment set up to run the Employment Analysis and Recommendation System on your machine. If any issues persist, please check the official documentation for the respective Python packages or reach out to community forums for assistance.
