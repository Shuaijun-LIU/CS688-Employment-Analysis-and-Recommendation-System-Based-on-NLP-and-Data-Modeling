Job gains occurred \nin health care, government, and construction.  \n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey measures\nlabor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The establishment\nsurvey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. For more information\nabout the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two surveys, see the Technical\nNote.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nBoth the unemployment rate, at 3.8 percent, and the number of unemployed people, at 6.4\nmillion, changed little in March. The unemployment rate has been in a narrow range of 3.7\npercent to 3.9 percent since August 2023. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for Blacks (6.4 percent) increased in\nMarch, while the rates for Asians (2.5 percent) and Hispanics (4.5 percent) decreased. The\njobless rates for adult men (3.3 percent), adult women (3.6 percent), teenagers (12.6\npercent), and Whites (3.4 percent) showed little or no change over the month. (See tables A-1,\nA-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more), at 1.2 million, was\nlittle changed in March. The long-term unemployed accounted for 19.5 percent of all unemployed\npeople. (See table A-12.)\n\nBoth the labor force participation rate, at 62.7 percent, and the employment-population ratio,\nat 60.3 percent, were little changed in March. These measures showed little change over the\nyear. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of people employed part time for economic reasons, at 4.3 million, changed little\nin March. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part\ntime because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See\ntable A-8.)\n\nIn March, the number of people not in the labor force who currently want a job, at 5.4\nmillion, was little changed. These individuals were not counted as unemployed because they\nwere not actively looking for work during the 4 weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable\nto take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of people marginally attached\nto the labor force, at 1.6 million, was little changed in March. These individuals wanted and\nwere available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not\nlooked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a\nsubset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them, was\nlittle changed at 337,000 in March. (See Summary table A.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 303,000 in March, higher than the average monthly\ngain of 231,000 over the prior 12 months. In March, job gains occurred in health care,\ngovernment, and construction. (See table B-1.)\n\nHealth care added 72,000 jobs in March, above the average monthly gain of 60,000 over the\nprior 12 months. In March, job growth continued in ambulatory health care services (+28,000),\nhospitals (+27,000), and nursing and residential care facilities (+18,000).\n\nIn March, employment in government increased by 71,000, higher than the average monthly gain\nof 54,000 over the prior 12 months. Over the month, employment increased in local government\n(+49,000) and federal government (+9,000). \n\nConstruction added 39,000 jobs in March, about double the average monthly gain of 19,000 over\nthe prior 12 months. Over the month, employment increased in nonresidential specialty trade\ncontractors (+16,000). \n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality trended up in March (+49,000) and has returned to its\npre-pandemic February 2020 level. Over the prior 12 months, job growth in the industry had\naveraged 37,000 per month.\n\nEmployment in the other services industry continued its upward trend in March (+16,000). The\nindustry had added an average of 8,000 jobs per month over the prior 12 months. Employment\nin other services remains below its February 2020 level by 40,000, or 0.7 percent.\n\nEmployment in social assistance continued to trend up in March (+9,000), below the average\nmonthly gain of 22,000 over the prior 12 months. \n\nIn March, employment was little changed in retail trade (+18,000). A job gain in general\nmerchandise retailers (+20,000) was partially offset by job losses in building material and\ngarden equipment and supplies dealers (-10,000) and in automotive parts, accessories, and tire\nretailers (-3,000). \n\nEmployment showed little or no change over the month in other major industries, including \nmining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction; manufacturing; wholesale trade; transportation\nand warehousing; information; financial activities; and professional and business services. \n\nIn March, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by\n12 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $34.69. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have\nincreased by 4.1 percent. In March, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and\nnonsupervisory employees edged up by 7 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $29.79. (See tables B-3 and\nB-8.) \n\nIn March, the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged up by 0.1\nhour to 34.4 hours. In manufacturing, the average workweek was unchanged at 40.0 hours, and\novertime edged down by 0.1 hour to 2.9 hours in March. The average workweek for production and\nnonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged up by 0.1 hour to 33.9 hours. (See\ntables B-2 and B-7.) \n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for January was revised up by 27,000, from\n+229,000 to +256,000, and the change for February was revised down by 5,000, from +275,000 to\n+270,000. With these revisions, employment in January and February combined is 22,000 higher\nthan previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from\nbusinesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the\nrecalculation of seasonal factors.)\n\n____________\nThe Employment Situation for April is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, May 3, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n\n",

Population estimates for the household survey are developed\nby the U.S. Census Bureau. Each year, the Census Bureau updates the estimates to reflect\nnew information and assumptions about the growth of the population since the population\nbase year, typically the last decennial census. The change in population reflected in \nthe new estimates results from adjustments for net international migration, updated vital\nstatistics, and improvements in estimation methodology. \n\nIn accordance with usual practice, BLS will not revise the official household survey\nestimates for December 2023 and earlier months. However, to show the impact of the\npopulation adjustments, table B displays differences in selected December labor force \nseries based on the old and new population estimates. \n\nThe adjustments decreased the estimated size of the civilian noninstitutional population\nin December by 625,000, the civilian labor force by 299,000, employment by 270,000,\nand unemployment by 28,000. The number of people not in the labor force decreased by \n326,000. The total unemployment rate, employment-population ratio, and labor force\nparticipation rate were unaffected. \n\nData users are cautioned that these annual population adjustments can affect the\ncomparability of household data series over time. Table C shows the effect of the\nintroduction of new population estimates on the change in selected labor force measures\nbetween December 2023 and January 2024. \n\nAdditional information on the population adjustments and their effects on national labor\nforce estimates is available at www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cps-pop-control-adjustments.pdf. \n\nPopulation controls for veterans, which are derived from a Department of Veterans Affairs\npopulation model and are updated periodically, did not change with the release of data\nfor January 2024. \n\n\n\n    Table B.

The unemployment     |\n |  rates for January 2023 through November 2023 (as originally published and as revised)  |\n |  appear in table A, along with additional information about the revisions.              |\n |_________________________________________________________________________________________|\n\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate held at 3.7 percent in December, and the number of unemployed \npersons was essentially unchanged at 6.3 million. These measures are higher than a \nyear earlier, when the jobless rate was 3.5 percent and the number of unemployed \npersons was 5.7 million. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.5 percent), \nadult women (3.3 percent), teenagers (11.9 percent), Whites (3.5 percent), Blacks \n(5.2 percent), Asians (3.1 percent), and Hispanics (5.0 percent) showed little change \nin December. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more), at 1.2 million,\nwas little changed in December and over the year. The long-term unemployed accounted \nfor 19.7 percent of all unemployed persons in December. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate, at 62.5 percent, and the employment-population ratio,\nat 60.1 percent, both decreased by 0.3 percentage point in December. These measures \nshowed little or no change over the year. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 4.2 million, changed \nlittle in December but was up by 333,000 over the year. These individuals, who would \nhave preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had \nbeen reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job edged up to 5.7\nmillion in December and was up by 514,000 over the year. These individuals were not\ncounted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work during the 4 \nweeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally \nattached to the labor force changed little at 1.6 million in December but was up by \n306,000 over the year. These individuals wanted and were available for work and had \nlooked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not looked for work in the \n4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a subset of the \nmarginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them, at 346,000, \nwas little changed in December and over the year. (See Summary table A.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 216,000 in December. Employment \ncontinued to trend up in government, health care, social assistance, and construction,\nwhile transportation and warehousing lost jobs. Payroll employment rose by 2.7 million \nin 2023 (an average monthly gain of 225,000), less than the increase of 4.8 million in\n2022 (an average monthly gain of 399,000). (See table B-1.) \n\nGovernment employment increased by 52,000 in December. Employment continued to trend\nup in local government (+37,000) and federal government (+7,000). Government added an\naverage of 56,000 jobs per month in 2023, more than double the average monthly gain of\n23,000 in 2022. \n\nIn December, health care added 38,000 jobs. Employment continued to trend up in \nambulatory health care services (+19,000) and hospitals (+15,000). Job growth in health \ncare averaged 55,000 per month in 2023, compared with the 2022 average monthly gain \nof 46,000. \n\nEmployment in social assistance rose by 21,000 in December, mostly in individual and \nfamily services (+17,000). Social assistance employment rose by an average of 22,000 \nper month in 2023, little different than the average increase of 19,000 per month \nin 2022. \n\nIn December, construction employment continued to trend up (+17,000). Employment in \nnonresidential building construction increased by 8,000. Construction added an average \nof 16,000 jobs per month in 2023, little different than the 2022 average monthly gain \nof 22,000. \n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing declined by 23,000 in December. Couriers \nand messengers lost 32,000 jobs, while air transportation added 4,000 jobs. Since \nreaching a peak in October 2022, employment in transportation and warehousing has \ndecreased by 100,000. \n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality changed little in December (+40,000). The \nindustry added an average of 39,000 jobs per month in 2023, less than half the \naverage gain of 88,000 jobs per month in 2022. Employment in the industry is\nbelow its pre-pandemic February 2020 level by 163,000, or 1.0 percent. \n\nRetail trade employment changed little in December (+17,000). Over the month, \nemployment increased in warehouse clubs, supercenters, and other general merchandise \nretailers (+14,000); building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers \n(+8,000); and automotive parts, accessories, and tire retailers (+4,000). These job\ngains were partially offset by a job loss in department stores (-13,000). Retail \ntrade employment has shown little change, on net, since recovering in early 2022 \nfrom pandemic-related losses. \n\nIn December, employment in professional and business services changed little (+13,000). \nEmployment in professional, scientific, and technical services continued to trend up\n(+25,000); this industry added an average of 22,000 jobs per month in 2023, about half \nthe average monthly gain of 41,000 in 2022. In December, employment in temporary help \nservices continued its downward trend (-33,000) and has fallen by 346,000 since reaching \na peak in March 2022. Overall, employment in professional and business services changed \nlittle in 2023.\n\nEmployment showed little change over the month in other major industries, including \nmining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction; manufacturing; wholesale trade; \ninformation; financial activities; and other services.\n\nIn December, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls \nrose by 15 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $34.27. Over the past 12 months, average hourly \nearnings have increased by 4.1 percent. In December, average hourly earnings of\nprivate-sector production and nonsupervisory employees rose by 10 cents, or 0.3 percent,\nto $29.42. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged down by 0.1 \nhour to 34.3 hours in December. In manufacturing, the average workweek was little changed \nat 39.8 hours, and overtime remained at 2.9 hours. The average workweek for production \nand nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged down by 0.1 hour to 33.7 \nhours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for October was revised down by 45,000, \nfrom +150,000 to +105,000, and the change for November was revised down by 26,000, from \n+199,000 to +173,000. With these revisions, employment in October and November combined \nis 71,000 lower than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional \nreports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published \nestimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for January is scheduled to be released on Friday, February 2, \n2024, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n  _________________________________________________________________________________________ \n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   |\n |                      Upcoming Changes to Household Survey Data                          |\n |                                                                                         |\n |  Effective with the release of The Employment Situation for January 2024 on February    |\n |  2, 2024, new population controls will be used in the household survey estimation       |\n |  process.

Job gains \noccurred in health care and government. Employment also increased in manufacturing, reflecting \nthe return of workers from a strike. Employment in retail trade declined.\n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey measures \nlabor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The establishment \nsurvey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. For more information about \nthe concepts and statistical methodology used in these two surveys, see the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate edged down to 3.7 percent in November, and the number of unemployed \npersons showed little change at 6.3 million. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for teenagers (11.4 percent) edged down \nin November. The jobless rates for adult men (3.7 percent), adult women (3.1 percent), Whites \n(3.3 percent), Blacks (5.8 percent), Asians (3.5 percent), and Hispanics (4.6 percent) showed\nlittle or no change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nIn November, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) edged \ndown to 1.2 million. These individuals accounted for 18.3 percent of all unemployed persons. \n(See table A-12.)\n\nThe employment-population ratio increased by 0.3 percentage point to 60.5 percent in November. \nThe labor force participation rate was little changed at 62.8 percent and has been essentially \nflat since August. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons decreased by 295,000 to 4.0 \nmillion in November. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were \nworking part time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time \njobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn November, the number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was 5.3\nmillion, little different from the prior month. These individuals were not counted as \nunemployed because they were not actively looking for work during the 4 weeks preceding the \nsurvey or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally attached \nto the labor force changed little at 1.6 million in November. These individuals wanted and were \navailable for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not looked \nfor work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a subset of the \nmarginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them, was 421,000 in November,\nessentially unchanged from the previous month. (See Summary table A.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 199,000 in November. Employment growth is below the\naverage monthly gain of 240,000 over the prior 12 months but is in line with job growth in recent \nmonths. In November, job gains occurred in health care and government. Employment also increased \nin manufacturing, reflecting the return of workers from a strike. Employment in retail trade \ndeclined. (See table B-1.)\n\nIn November, health care added 77,000 jobs, above the average monthly gain of 54,000 over the \nprior 12 months. Over the month, job gains continued in ambulatory health care services (+36,000),\nhospitals (+24,000), and nursing and residential care facilities (+17,000). \n\nGovernment employment increased by 49,000 in November, in line with the average monthly gain of \n55,000 over the prior 12 months. Employment continued to trend up in local government (+32,000) \nand state government (+17,000) over the month.\n\nEmployment in manufacturing rose by 28,000 in November, reflecting an increase of 30,000 in \nmotor vehicles and parts as workers returned from a strike. Employment in manufacturing has\nshown little net change over the year.\n\nIn November, employment in leisure and hospitality continued to trend up (+40,000), almost\nentirely in food services and drinking places. Leisure and hospitality had added an average of\n51,000 jobs per month over the prior 12 months. \n\nEmployment in social assistance continued to trend up in November (+16,000). The industry had \nadded an average of 23,000 jobs per month over the prior 12 months. Over the month, employment\ncontinued to trend up in individual and family services (+9,000). \n\nRetail trade employment declined by 38,000 in November and has shown little net change over the \nyear. Employment decreased in department stores (-19,000) and in furniture, home furnishings, \nelectronics, and appliance retailers (-6,000) over the month. \n\nIn November, employment in information changed little (+10,000). Motion picture and sound \nrecording industries added 17,000 jobs, mostly reflecting the resolution of labor disputes in \nthe industry. Overall, employment in the information industry has declined by 104,000 since\nreaching a peak in November 2022. \n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing changed little in November (-5,000). A job loss \nin warehousing and storage (-8,000) was partially offset by a gain in air transportation \n(+4,000). Employment in transportation and warehousing has declined by 61,000 since a peak\nin October 2022. \n\nEmployment showed little change over the month in other major industries, including mining, \nquarrying, and oil and gas extraction; construction; wholesale trade; financial activities; \nprofessional and business services; and other services.\n\nIn November, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 12 \ncents, or 0.4 percent, to $34.10. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have \nincreased by 4.0 percent. In November, average hourly earnings of private-sector production \nand nonsupervisory employees rose by 12 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $29.30. (See tables B-3 and \nB-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged up by 0.1 hour to \n34.4 hours in November. In manufacturing, the average workweek was unchanged at 40.0 hours, \nand overtime remained at 2.9 hours. The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory \nemployees on private nonfarm payrolls edged up by 0.1 hour to 33.8 hours. (See tables B-2 and\nB-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for September was revised down by 35,000, from \n+297,000 to +262,000, and the change for October remained at +150,000. With these revisions, \nemployment in September and October combined is 35,000 lower than previously reported.

Job gains\noccurred in health care, government, and social assistance. Employment declined in manufacturing\ndue to strike activity.\n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey measures\nlabor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The establishment\nsurvey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. For more information about\nthe concepts and statistical methodology used in these two surveys, see the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nBoth the unemployment rate, at 3.9 percent, and the number of unemployed persons, at 6.5 million,\nchanged little in October. However, since their recent lows in April, these measures are up by\n0.5 percentage point and 849,000, respectively. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.7 percent), adult women\n(3.3 percent), teenagers (13.2 percent), Whites (3.5 percent), Blacks (5.8 percent), Asians (3.1\npercent), and Hispanics (4.8 percent) showed little change in October.

The long-term unemployed accounted for 19.8 percent of all unemployed\npersons. (See table A-12.)\n\nBoth the labor force participation rate, at 62.7 percent, and the employment-population ratio,\nat 60.2 percent, changed little in October. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 4.3 million, changed little\nin October. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part\ntime because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table\nA-8.)\n\nIn October, the number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was 5.4\nmillion, little different from the prior month. These individuals were not counted as unemployed\nbecause they were not actively looking for work during the 4 weeks preceding the survey or were\nunavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally attached\nto the labor force changed little at 1.4 million in October. These individuals wanted and were\navailable for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not looked\nfor work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a subset of\nthe marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them, also changed little\nover the month at 416,000. (See Summary table A.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 150,000 in October, below the average monthly gain\nof 258,000 over the prior 12 months. In October, job gains occurred in health care, government,\nand social assistance. Employment in manufacturing declined due to strike activity. (See table\nB-1.)\n\nHealth care added 58,000 jobs in October, in line with the average monthly gain of 53,000 over\nthe prior 12 months. Over the month, employment continued to trend up in ambulatory health care\nservices (+32,000), hospitals (+18,000), and nursing and residential care facilities (+8,000).\n\nEmployment in government increased by 51,000 in October and has returned to its pre-pandemic\nFebruary 2020 level. Monthly job growth in government had averaged 50,000 in the prior 12\nmonths. In October, employment continued to trend up in local government (+38,000). \n\nSocial assistance added 19,000 jobs in October, compared with the average monthly gain of \n23,000 over the prior 12 months. Over the month, employment continued to trend up in individual\nand family services (+14,000).\n\nIn October, construction employment continued to trend up (+23,000), about in line with the \naverage monthly gain of 18,000 over the prior 12 months. Employment continued to trend up over\nthe month in specialty trade contractors (+14,000) and construction of buildings (+6,000).\n\nEmployment in manufacturing decreased by 35,000 in October, reflecting a decline of 33,000 in\nmotor vehicles and parts that was largely due to strike activity. \n\nIn October, employment in leisure and hospitality changed little (+19,000). The industry had\nadded an average of 52,000 jobs per month over the prior 12 months. \n\nEmployment in professional and business services was little changed in October (+15,000) and\nhas shown little net change since May. Employment in temporary help services changed little\nover the month (+7,000) but is 229,000 below its peak in March 2022.\n\nIn October, employment in transportation and warehousing was little changed (-12,000) and has\nshown little net change over the year. Over the month, warehousing and storage lost 11,000\njobs, while air transportation added 4,000 jobs.\n\nInformation employment changed little in October (-9,000). Employment in motion picture and\nsound recording continued to trend down (-5,000); the industry has lost 44,000 jobs since\nMay, at least partially reflecting the impact of an ongoing labor dispute.\n\nOver the month, employment showed little change in other major industries, including mining,\nquarrying, and oil and gas extraction; wholesale trade; retail trade; financial activities;\nand other services.\n\nIn October, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by\n7 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $34.00. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have\nincreased by 4.1 percent. In October, average hourly earnings of private-sector production\nand nonsupervisory employees rose by 10 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $29.19.

In manufacturing, the average workweek was little changed at 40.0\nhours, and overtime edged down by 0.1 hour to 2.9 hours. The average workweek for production\nand nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged down by 0.1 hour to 33.7 hours.\n(See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for August was revised down by 62,000, from\n+227,000 to +165,000, and the change for September was revised down by 39,000, from +336,000\nto +297,000.

In January, average hourly earnings of private-\nsector production and nonsupervisory employees rose by 7 cents, or 0.2 percent, to \n$28.26. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 0.3 hour to\n34.7 hours in January. In manufacturing, the average workweek increased by 0.4 hour to\n40.5 hours, and overtime increased by 0.1 hour to 3.1 hours. The average workweek for\nproduction and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.2\nhour to 34.1 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for November was revised up by 34,000,\nfrom +256,000 to +290,000, and the change for December was revised up by 37,000, from\n+223,000 to +260,000. With these revisions, employment gains in November and December\ncombined were 71,000 higher than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from\nadditional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last \npublished estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors. The annual \nbenchmark process also contributed to the November and December revisions.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for February is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, March 10, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n                        Revisions to Establishment Survey Data                        \n\nIn accordance with annual practice, the establishment survey data released today have \nbeen benchmarked to reflect comprehensive counts of payroll jobs for March 2022. These\ncounts are derived principally from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW),\nwhich counts jobs covered by the Unemployment Insurance (UI) tax system. In addition,\nthe basis for industry classification in the establishment survey has been revised\nfrom the 2017 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) to NAICS 2022. \nApproximately 10 percent of employment was reclassified into different industries as\na result of the NAICS revision. Implementation of NAICS 2022 resulted in major \nrevisions reflecting content and coding changes in the retail trade and information\nsectors, as well as minor revisions within the mining and logging, manufacturing, \nwholesale trade, financial activities, and other services sectors. Many industry \ntitles and descriptions were also updated to better reflect official NAICS titles. \n\nRevisions due to both the NAICS 2022 conversion and the benchmark process affected \nmore historical data than typical in the annual benchmark process. The NAICS \nrevisions are reflected for the entire history of affected industries for both \nseasonally and not seasonally adjusted data. Details of the updated titles and new,\ndiscontinued, and collapsed industries (and resulting changes to tables B-1 through\nB-9) are available at www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesnewseries.htm. \n\nThe total nonfarm employment level for March 2022 was revised upward by 568,000 \n(+506,000 on a not seasonally adjusted basis, or +0.3 percent). The average not \nseasonally adjusted benchmark revision (in absolute terms) over the past 10 years is\n0.1 percent.  \n\nThe over-the-year change in total nonfarm employment for March 2022 was revised from\n+6,425,000 to +7,096,000 (seasonally adjusted). Table A presents revised total \nnonfarm employment data on a seasonally adjusted basis from January to December 2022.\n\nAll revised historical establishment survey data are available on the BLS website at\nwww.bls.gov/ces/data/home.htm. In addition, an article that discusses the benchmark\nand post-benchmark revisions and other technical issues is available at \nwww.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesbmart.htm.\n\n\nTable A.

Population estimates for the household survey are developed \nby the U.S. Census Bureau. Each year, the Census Bureau updates the estimates to \nreflect new information and assumptions about the growth of the population since the \nprevious decennial census. The change in population reflected in the new estimates \nresults from adjustments for net international migration, updated vital statistics, and\nimprovements in estimation methodology. \n\nIn accordance with usual practice, BLS will not revise the official household survey \nestimates for December 2022 and earlier months. However, to show the impact of the\npopulation adjustments, table B displays differences in selected December labor force\nseries based on the old and new population estimates.\n\nThe adjustments increased the estimated size of the civilian noninstitutional\npopulation in December by 954,000, the civilian labor force by 871,000, employment by\n810,000, and unemployment by 60,000. The number of persons not in the labor force \nincreased by 82,000. Although the total unemployment rate was unaffected, the \nemployment-population ratio and labor force participation rate each increased by 0.1\npercentage point.\n\nData users are cautioned that these annual population adjustments can affect the \ncomparability of household data series over time. Table C shows the effect of the \nintroduction of new population estimates on the change in selected labor force\nmeasures between December 2022 and January 2023. Additional information on the \npopulation adjustments and their effect on national labor force estimates is \navailable at www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cps-pop-control-adjustments.pdf.\n\nPopulation controls for veterans, which are derived from a Department of Veterans \nAffairs population model and are updated periodically, have also been updated with \nthe release of data for January 2023. Historical data have not been revised.\n\n\n\n    Table B.

Seasonally \t|\n| adjusted estimates back to January 2018 were subject to revision. The unemployment \t|\n| rates for January 2022 through November 2022 (as originally published and as revised) |\n| appear in table A at the end of this news release, along with additional information  |\n| about the revisions.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|_______________________________________________________________________________________|\n\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate edged down to 3.5 percent in December and has remained in a narrow \nrange of 3.5 percent to 3.7 percent since March. The number of unemployed persons edged \ndown to 5.7 million in December. (See table A-1.) \n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for Whites fell to 3.0 percent in \nDecember. The jobless rates for adult men (3.1 percent), adult women (3.2 percent), \nteenagers (10.4 percent), Blacks (5.7 percent), Asians (2.4 percent), and Hispanics (4.1 \npercent) showed little or no change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.) \n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) declined by 146,000\nto 1.1 million in December. This measure is down from 2.0 million a year earlier. The long-\nterm unemployed accounted for 18.5 percent of all unemployed persons. (See table A-12.) \n\nThe employment-population ratio increased by 0.2 percentage point over the month to 60.1 \npercent. The labor force participation rate was little changed at 62.3 percent. Both measures\nhave shown little net change since early 2022. These measures are each 1.0 percentage point\nbelow their values in February 2020, prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \n(See table A-1.) \n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 3.9 million, changed little\nin December. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working \npart time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. \n(See table A-8.) \n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job fell by 352,000 to 5.2\nmillion in December and is little different from its February 2020 level of 5.1 million. \nThese individuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for\nwork during the 4 weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take a job. \n(See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally \nattached to the labor force declined by 231,000 to 1.3 million in December. These individuals\nwanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months\nbut had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged \nworkers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for \nthem, numbered 410,000 in December, essentially unchanged from the previous month. \n(See Summary table A.) \n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 223,000 in December. Notable job gains occurred\nin leisure and hospitality, health care, construction, and social assistance. Payroll \nemployment rose by 4.5 million in 2022 (an average monthly gain of 375,000), less than the \nincrease of 6.7 million in 2021 (an average monthly gain of 562,000). (See table B-1.)\n\nIn December, employment in leisure and hospitality rose by 67,000. Employment continued to \ntrend up in food services and drinking places (+26,000); amusements, gambling, and recreation\n(+25,000); and accommodation (+10,000). Leisure and hospitality added an average of 79,000\njobs per month in 2022, substantially less than the average gain of 196,000 jobs per month in\n2021. Employment in the industry remains below its pre-pandemic February 2020 level by \n932,000, or 5.5 percent.\n\nHealth care employment increased by 55,000 in December, with gains in ambulatory health care\nservices (+30,000), hospitals (+16,000), and nursing and residential care facilities (+9,000).\nJob growth in health care averaged 49,000 per month in 2022, considerably above the 2021\naverage monthly gain of 9,000.\n\nEmployment in construction increased by 28,000 in December, as specialty trade contractors\nadded 17,000 jobs. Construction employment increased by an average of 19,000 per month in \n2022, little different than the average of 16,000 per month in 2021.\n\nSocial assistance added 20,000 jobs in December. Employment in individual and family services\ncontinued to trend up over the month (+10,000). Job growth in social assistance averaged \n17,000 per month in 2022, compared with the 2021 average of 13,000 per month.\n\nEmployment in the other services industry continued to trend up in December (+14,000). \nMonthly job growth in other services averaged 14,000 in 2022, lower than the average of \n24,000 per month in 2021. Employment in other services is below its February 2020 level by \n174,000, or 2.9 percent. \n\nIn December, mining employment increased by 4,000, reflecting job growth in support\nactivities for mining (+5,000). Since a recent low in February 2021, mining employment has \ngrown by 104,000.\n\nEmployment in retail trade changed little in December (+9,000). Job growth in retail trade \naveraged 16,000 per month in 2022, less than half the average growth of 35,000 per month in \n2021.\n\nOver the month, employment in manufacturing changed little (+8,000), as job gains in durable\ngoods (+24,000) were partially offset by losses in nondurable goods (-16,000). In 2022, \nmanufacturing added an average of 32,000 jobs per month, little different than the average \nof 30,000 jobs per month in 2021.\n\nIn December, employment in transportation and warehousing changed little (+5,000). Air \ntransportation (+3,000) added jobs over the month, while employment continued to trend down \nin couriers and messengers (-4,000) and in warehousing and storage (-3,000). In 2022, average\njob growth in transportation and warehousing (+17,000) was about half the average job growth\nin 2021 (+36,000).\n\nIn December, government employment was essentially unchanged (+3,000). Employment in state \ngovernment education declined by 24,000, reflecting strike activity among university \nemployees.\n\nEmployment in professional and business services remained little changed in December \n(-6,000). Employment in temporary help services declined by 35,000 over the month and has \nfallen by 111,000 since July. Job growth in professional and business services averaged \n50,000 per month in 2022, roughly half of the average of 94,000 per month in 2021.\n\nOver the month, employment showed little change in other major industries, including \nwholesale trade, information, and financial activities.\n\nIn December, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by \n9 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $32.82. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have\nincreased by 4.6 percent. In December, average hourly earnings of private-sector production\nand nonsupervisory employees rose by 6 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $28.07. (See tables B-3 \nand B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls declined by 0.1 hour to\n34.3 hours in December. In manufacturing, the average workweek for all employees was little\nchanged at 40.1 hours, and overtime declined by 0.2 hour to 2.9 hours. The average workweek\nfor production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased by 0.1 \nhour to 33.8 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for October was revised down by 21,000, from\n+284,000 to +263,000, and the change for November was revised down by 7,000, from +263,000 \nto +256,000. With these revisions, employment gains in October and November combined were \n28,000 lower than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports \nreceived from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and \nfrom the recalculation of seasonal factors.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for January is scheduled to be released on Friday, \nFebruary 3, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\tUpcoming Changes to Household Survey Data\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Effective with the release of The Employment Situation for January 2023 on February \t|\n| 3, 2023, new population controls will be used in the household survey estimation \t|\n| process.

The household survey \nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The\nestablishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. For \nmore information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two surveys,\nsee the Technical Note. \n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7 percent in November and has been in a narrow \nrange of 3.5 percent to 3.7 percent since March. The number of unemployed persons was \nessentially unchanged at 6.0 million in November. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.4 percent), adult \nwomen (3.3 percent), teenagers (11.3 percent), Whites (3.2 percent), Blacks (5.7 percent),\nAsians (2.7 percent), and Hispanics (3.9 percent) showed little or no change over the\nmonth. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of permanent job losers rose by 127,000 to 1.4 million in\nNovember. The number of persons on temporary layoff changed little at 803,000. \n(See table A-11.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little changed\nat 1.2 million in November. The long-term unemployed accounted for 20.6 percent of all \nunemployed persons. (See table A-12.)\n\nBoth the labor force participation rate, at 62.1 percent, and the employment-population \nratio, at 59.9 percent, were little changed in November and have shown little net change \nsince early this year. These measures are each 1.3 percentage points below their values in\nFebruary 2020, prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons was about unchanged at 3.7\nmillion in November. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment,\nwere working part time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find \nfull-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was little changed \nat 5.6 million in November and remains above its February 2020 level of 5.0 million. These\nindividuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work\nduring the 4 weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally \nattached to the labor force held at 1.5 million in November. These individuals wanted and\nwere available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had\nnot looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged\nworkers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available \nfor them, was 405,000 in November, little changed from the previous month. (See Summary\ntable A.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 263,000 in November, roughly in line with\naverage growth over the prior 3 months (+282,000). Monthly job growth has averaged 392,000\nthus far in 2022, compared with 562,000 per month in 2021. In November, notable job gains\noccurred in leisure and hospitality, health care, and government. Employment declined in\nretail trade and in transportation and warehousing. (See table B-1.) \n\nLeisure and hospitality added 88,000 jobs in November, including a gain of 62,000 in food\nservices and drinking places.

The unemployment rate has been in a narrow\nrange of 3.5 percent to 3.7 percent since March. (See table A-1.) \n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult women (3.4 percent) and Whites \n(3.2 percent) rose in October. The jobless rates for adult men (3.3 percent), teenagers (11.0\npercent), Blacks (5.9 percent), Asians (2.9 percent), and Hispanics (4.2 percent) showed little\nor no change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of permanent job losers changed little at 1.2 million in October,\nand the number of persons on temporary layoff also changed little at 847,000. (See table A-11.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little changed at\n1.2 million in October. The long-term unemployed accounted for 19.5 percent of all unemployed\npersons. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate, at 62.2 percent, and the employment-population ratio, at\n60.0 percent, were about unchanged in October and have shown little net change since early\nthis year. These measures are 1.2 percentage points below their values in February 2020, prior\nto the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. (See table A-1.) \n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons was little changed at 3.7 million\nin October. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part\ntime because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table\nA-8.)\n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was little changed at 5.7\nmillion in October and remains above its February 2020 level of 5.0 million. These individuals\nwere not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work during the 4 weeks\npreceding the survey or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally attached\nto the labor force was little changed in October at 1.5 million. These individuals wanted and\nwere available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not \nlooked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a subset\nof the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them, decreased by\n114,000 to 371,000 in October. (See Summary table A.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 261,000 in October.

Within social assistance, employment in individual and\nfamily services continued to trend up in October (+10,000).\n\nWholesale trade added 15,000 jobs in October. Employment in wholesale trade has increased by an\naverage of 17,000 per month thus far in 2022, compared with 13,000 per month in 2021. \n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality continued to trend up in October (+35,000), with \naccommodation adding 20,000 jobs. Employment in food services and drinking places changed little\nover the month (+6,000). Leisure and hospitality has added an average of 78,000 jobs per month thus far\nthis year, less than half of the average gain of 196,000 jobs per month in 2021. Employment in\nleisure and hospitality is down by 1.1 million, or 6.5 percent, from its February 2020 level.\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing changed little in October (+8,000). Within the\nindustry, job growth occurred in truck transportation (+13,000), couriers and messengers \n(+7,000), and air transportation (+4,000). These gains were partially offset by a job loss in \nwarehousing and storage (-20,000). Monthly job growth in transportation and warehousing has\naveraged 25,000 thus far this year, compared with 36,000 per month in 2021.\n\nIn October, financial activities employment was little changed (+3,000). Within the industry,\njob gains in insurance carriers and related activities (+9,000) and in securities, commodity\ncontracts, and investments (+5,000) were partially offset by a job loss in rental and leasing\nservices (-8,000).

In manufacturing, the average workweek for all employees was little\nchanged at 40.4 hours, and overtime decreased by 0.1 hour to 3.1 hours. The average workweek for\nproduction and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls held at 34.0 hours. (See \ntables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for August was revised down by 23,000, from \n+315,000 to +292,000, and the change for September was revised up by 52,000, from +263,000 to \n+315,000. With these revisions, employment gains in August and September combined were 29,000 \nhigher than previously reported.

(See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for Hispanics decreased to 3.8 percent\nin September. The jobless rates for adult men (3.3 percent), adult women (3.1 percent),\nteenagers (11.4 percent), Whites (3.1 percent), Blacks (5.8 percent), and Asians (2.5 \npercent) showed little change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of permanent job losers decreased by 173,000 to 1.2 \nmillion in September. The number of persons on temporary layoff changed little at 758,000.\n(See table A-11.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little changed \nat 1.1 million in September. The long-term unemployed accounted for 18.5 percent of all \nunemployed persons. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate was little changed at 62.3 percent in September, and the\nemployment-population ratio was unchanged at 60.1 percent. Both measures are 1.1 percentage\npoints below their values in February 2020, prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \n(See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons decreased by 306,000 to 3.8\nmillion in September. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, \nwere working part time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find \nfull-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was little changed at\n5.8 million in September and remains above its February 2020 level of 5.0 million. These \nindividuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work\nduring the 4 weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally \nattached to the labor force was little changed in September at 1.6 million. These \nindividuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the \nprior 12 months but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number\nof discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were\navailable for them, increased by 119,000 to 485,000 in September. (See Summary table A.)\n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data\n\nIn September, 5.2 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus \npandemic, down from 6.5 percent in the prior month. In May 2020, the first month these data\nwere collected, 35.4 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus \npandemic. These data refer to employed persons who teleworked or worked at home for pay at\nsome point in the 4 weeks preceding the survey specifically because of the pandemic.\n\nIn September, 1.4 million persons reported they had been unable to work because their \nemployer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not work at all\nor worked fewer hours at some point in the 4 weeks preceding the survey due to the \npandemic. This measure is down from 1.9 million in the previous month and from 49.8 million\nin May 2020. Among those who reported in September that they were unable to work because of\npandemic-related closures or lost business, 21.4 percent received at least some pay from \ntheir employer for the hours not worked, essentially the same as in August. \n\nAmong those not in the labor force in September, 452,000 persons were prevented from looking\nfor work due to the pandemic, little changed from the prior month. In May 2020, 9.7 million\npersons were prevented from looking for work due to the pandemic. (To be counted as \nunemployed, by definition, individuals must be either actively looking for work or on \ntemporary layoff.)\n\nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey from May 2020 \nthrough September 2022 to help gauge the effects of the pandemic on the labor market. The \ndata are not seasonally adjusted.

Notable job gains\noccurred in professional and business services, health care, and retail trade.\n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey \nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The\nestablishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. For more\ninformation about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two surveys, see\nthe Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn August, the unemployment rate rose by 0.2 percentage point to 3.7 percent, and the \nnumber of unemployed persons increased by 344,000 to 6.0 million. In July, these measures\nhad returned to their levels in February 2020, prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) \npandemic. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.5 percent) and \nHispanics (4.5 percent) rose in August. The jobless rates for adult women (3.3 percent),\nteenagers (10.4 percent), Whites (3.2 percent), Blacks (6.4 percent), and Asians (2.8\npercent) showed little change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of permanent job losers increased by 188,000 to 1.4 \nmillion in August. The number of persons on temporary layoff was virtually unchanged at \n782,000. (See table A-11.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little changed\nat 1.1 million in August. The long-term unemployed accounted for 18.8 percent of all \nunemployed persons. (See table A-12.) \n\nThe labor force participation rate increased by 0.3 percentage point over the month to \n62.4 percent but is 1.0 percentage point below its February 2020 level. The employment-\npopulation ratio was little changed at 60.1 percent in August and remains 1.1 percentage \npoints below its February 2020 value. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons was little changed at 4.1 \nmillion in August. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were\nworking part time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-\ntime jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job declined by 361,000\nto 5.5 million in August. This measure remains above its February 2020 level of 5.0 \nmillion. These individuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively\nlooking for work during the 4 weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take a\njob. (See table A-1.) \n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally \nattached to the labor force, at 1.4 million, was little changed in August. These\nindividuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the\nprior 12 months but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. \nDiscouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were \navailable for them, numbered 366,000 in August, little changed from the prior month. \n(See Summary table A.)\n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data\n\nIn August, 6.5 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus pandemic,\ndown from 7.1 percent in the prior month. These data refer to employed persons who \nteleworked or worked at home for pay at some point in the 4 weeks preceding the survey \nspecifically because of the pandemic. \n\nIn August, 1.9 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because their \nemployer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not work at all or\nworked fewer hours at some point in the 4 weeks preceding the survey due to the pandemic.\nThis measure is down from 2.2 million in the previous month. Among those who reported in \nAugust that they were unable to work because of pandemic-related closures or lost business,\n21.5 percent received at least some pay from their employer for the hours not worked, \nlittle different from the previous month.\n\nAmong those not in the labor force in August, 523,000 persons were prevented from looking\nfor work due to the pandemic, little changed from the prior month. (To be counted as \nunemployed, by definition, individuals must be either actively looking for work or on \ntemporary layoff.) \n\nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey in May 2020 to \nhelp gauge the effects of the pandemic on the labor market. The data are not seasonally \nadjusted. Tables with estimates from the supplemental questions for all months are \navailable online at www.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm. \n(For more information about upcoming changes to these supplemental data, see the box note\nat the end of this news release.) \n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 315,000 in August. Nonfarm employment has \nrisen by 5.8 million over the past 12 months, as the labor market continued to recover \nfrom the job losses of the pandemic-induced recession. This growth brings total nonfarm \nemployment 240,000 higher than its pre-pandemic level in February 2020. In August, \nnotable job gains occurred in professional and business services, health care, and retail\ntrade. (See table B-1.)\n\nProfessional and business services added 68,000 jobs in August. Within the industry, \nemployment gains occurred in computer systems design and related services (+14,000), \nmanagement and technical consulting services (+13,000), architectural and engineering \nservices (+10,000), and scientific research and development services (+6,000), while \nlegal services lost jobs (-9,000). Over the past 12 months, professional and business \nservices has added 1.1 million jobs.\n\nIn August, health care employment rose by 48,000, with job gains in offices of \nphysicians (+15,000), hospitals (+15,000), and nursing and residential care facilities \n(+12,000). Health care has added 412,000 jobs over the year. Despite this growth, \nemployment in health care is below its February 2020 level by 37,000, or 0.2 percent.\n\nRetail trade added 44,000 jobs in August and 422,000 jobs over the past 12 months. In \nAugust, employment increased in general merchandise stores (+15,000), food and beverage\nstores (+15,000), health and personal care stores (+10,000), and building material and \ngarden supply stores (+7,000). Employment in furniture and home furnishings stores \ncontinued to trend down (-3,000).\n\nManufacturing employment continued to trend up in August (+22,000), with gains \nconcentrated in durable goods industries (+19,000). Manufacturing has added 461,000 jobs\nover the year. \n\nEmployment in financial activities rose by 17,000 in August and by 200,000 over the year.\n\nEmployment in wholesale trade increased by 15,000 in August, returning to its February \n2020 level. This industry has added 197,000 jobs over the year. \n\nMining employment rose by 6,000 in August, reflecting a gain in support activities for \nmining (+7,000). Over the year, mining has added 68,000 jobs. \n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality changed little in August (+31,000), following \naverage monthly gains of 90,000 in the first 7 months of the year. Employment in leisure\nand hospitality is below its February 2020 level by 1.2 million, or 7.2 percent.\n\nIn August, employment showed little change in other major industries, including \nconstruction, transportation and warehousing, information, other services, and \ngovernment.\n\nIn August, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by\n10 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $32.36. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings \nhave increased by 5.2 percent. In August, average hourly earnings of private-sector \nproduction and nonsupervisory employees rose by 10 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $27.68. \n(See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased by 0.1 \nhour to 34.5 hours in August. In manufacturing, the average workweek for all employees\nwas little changed at 40.3 hours, and overtime held at 3.3 hours. The average workweek \nfor production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls declined by 0.1\nhour to 33.9 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for June was revised down by 105,000, \nfrom +398,000 to +293,000, and the change for July was revised down by 2,000, from \n+528,000 to +526,000. With these revisions, employment in June and July combined is \n107,000 lower than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional \nreports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published \nestimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for September is scheduled to be released on Friday, \nOctober 7, 2022, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t Upcoming Changes to Household Survey Supplemental Data \t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| The supplemental questions that BLS added to the household survey in May 2020 to \t|\n| examine the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the labor market will \t|\n| be asked for the last time in September 2022.

Notable\njob gains occurred in professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, \nand health care.\n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey\nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics.\nThe establishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry.\nFor more information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these\ntwo surveys, see the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate was 3.6 percent for the fourth month in a row, and the number\nof unemployed persons was essentially unchanged at 5.9 million in June. These measures\nare little different from their values in February 2020 (3.5 percent and 5.7 million,\nrespectively), prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for Asians increased to 3.0 percent\nin June. The jobless rates for adult men (3.3 percent), adult women (3.3 percent),\nteenagers (11.0 percent), Whites (3.3 percent), Blacks (5.8 percent), and Hispanics \n(4.3 percent) showed little or no change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, both the number of permanent job losers, at 1.3 million in June,\nand the number of persons on temporary layoff, at 827,000, changed little over the\nmonth. These measures are little different from their values in February 2020. (See\ntable A-11.)\n\nIn June, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was\nessentially unchanged at 1.3 million. This measure is 215,000 higher than in February\n2020. The long-term unemployed accounted for 22.6 percent of all unemployed persons in\nJune. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate, at 62.2 percent, and the employment-population ratio,\nat 59.9 percent, were little changed over the month. Both measures remain below their\nFebruary 2020 values (63.4 percent and 61.2 percent, respectively). (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons declined by 707,000 to \n3.6 million in June and is below its February 2020 level of 4.4 million. These individuals,\nwho would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours\nhad been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.) \n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was essentially\nunchanged at 5.7 million in June. This measure is above its February 2020 level of 5.0\nmillion. These individuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively\nlooking for work during the 4 weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take a job.\n(See table A-1.) \n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally\nattached to the labor force, at 1.5 million, was essentially unchanged in June. These \nindividuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the\nprior 12 months but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. Discouraged\nworkers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available\nfor them, numbered 364,000 in June, little changed from the prior month. (See Summary \ntable A.) \n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data \n\nIn June, 7.1 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus pandemic,\ndown from 7.4 percent in the prior month. These data refer to employed persons who\nteleworked or worked at home for pay at some point in the 4 weeks preceding the survey\nspecifically because of the pandemic. \n\nIn June, 2.1 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because their\nemployer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not work at\nall or worked fewer hours at some point in the 4 weeks preceding the survey due to\nthe pandemic. This measure is up from 1.8 million in the previous month. Among those\nwho reported in June that they were unable to work because of pandemic-related closures\nor lost business, 24.8 percent received at least some pay from their employer for the\nhours not worked, little different from the previous month. \n\nAmong those not in the labor force in June, 610,000 persons were prevented from looking\nfor work due to the pandemic, up from 455,000 in the prior month. (To be counted as\nunemployed, by definition, individuals must be either actively looking for work or on\ntemporary layoff.) \n\nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey beginning in\nMay 2020 to help gauge the effects of the pandemic on the labor market. The data are\nnot seasonally adjusted.

Notable job\ngains continued in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, retail\ntrade, and manufacturing.\n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey \nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. \nThe establishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry.\nFor more information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two \nsurveys, see the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate declined by 0.2 percentage point to 3.6 percent in March, and the\nnumber of unemployed persons decreased by 318,000 to 6.0 million. These measures are \nlittle different from their values in February 2020 (3.5 percent and 5.7 million, \nrespectively), prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for adult women (3.3 percent) \ndeclined in March. The jobless rates for adult men (3.4 percent), teenagers (10.0 \npercent), Whites (3.2 percent), Blacks (6.2 percent), Asians (2.8 percent), and \nHispanics (4.2 percent) showed little change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2,\nand A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of permanent job losers decreased by 191,000 to 1.4 \nmillion in March and is little different from its February 2020 level of 1.3 million. \nThe number of persons on temporary layoff was little changed over the month at 787,000\nand has essentially returned to its February 2020 level. The number of job leavers--that\nis, unemployed persons who quit or voluntarily left their previous job and began looking\nfor new employment--fell by 176,000 to 787,000 in March. (See table A-11.)\n\nIn March, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more)\ndecreased by 274,000 to 1.4 million. This measure is 307,000 higher than in February \n2020. The long-term unemployed accounted for 23.9 percent of all unemployed persons in \nMarch. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate, at 62.4 percent, changed little in March. The \nemployment-population ratio increased by 0.2 percentage point to 60.1 percent. Both \nmeasures remain below their February 2020 values (63.4 percent and 61.2 percent, \nrespectively). (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons was about unchanged at 4.2\nmillion in March and is little different from its February 2020 level.

(See table A-8.)\n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job increased by \n382,000 to 5.7 million in March, following a decrease of a similar magnitude in the prior\nmonth. This measure is above its February 2020 level of 5.0 million. These individuals \nwere not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work during the\n4 weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally \nattached to the labor force, at 1.4 million, changed little in March. These individuals\nwanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 \nmonths but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of \ndiscouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were\navailable for them, was essentially unchanged over the month at 373,000. (See Summary \ntable A.)\n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data\n\nIn March, 10.0 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus pandemic,\ndown from 13.0 percent in the prior month. These data refer to employed persons who \nteleworked or worked at home for pay at some point in the 4 weeks preceding the survey \nspecifically because of the pandemic.\n\nIn March, 2.5 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because their\nemployer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not work at all\nor worked fewer hours at some point in the 4 weeks preceding the survey due to the \npandemic.

(See tables B-2 and B-7.) \n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for December was revised up by 78,000, from\n+510,000 to +588,000, and the change for January was revised up by 14,000, from +467,000\nto +481,000. With these revisions, employment in December and January combined is 92,000\nhigher than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received\nfrom businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the \nrecalculation of seasonal factors.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for March is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, April 1, 2022, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n\n",

Employment growth continued in leisure and hospitality, in professional and\nbusiness services, in retail trade, and in transportation and warehousing. \n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey\nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics.\nThe establishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry.\nFor more information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two\nsurveys, see the Technical Note.\n\n ____________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     |\n|                      Changes to The Employment Situation Data                      |\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     |\n| Establishment survey data have been revised as a result of the annual benchmarking |\n| process and the updating of seasonal adjustment factors.

Over the year, the unemployment rate is down\nby 2.4 percentage points, and the number of unemployed persons declined by 3.7 million.\nIn February 2020, prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the unemployment rate\nwas 3.5 percent, and unemployed persons numbered 5.7 million. (See table A-1. See the\nnote at the end of this news release and tables B and C for information about annual\npopulation adjustments to the household survey estimates.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.8 percent) and\nWhites (3.4 percent) edged up in January. The jobless rates for adult women (3.6 percent),\nteenagers (10.9 percent), Blacks (6.9 percent), Asians (3.6 percent), and Hispanics \n(4.9 percent) showed little or no change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of job leavers increased to 952,000 in January, following\na decrease in the prior month. The number of persons on temporary layoff, at 959,000 in\nJanuary, also increased over the month but is down by 1.8 million over the year. The \nnumber of permanent job losers, at 1.6 million, changed little in January but is down\nby 1.9 million from a year earlier. (See table A-11.)\n\nIn January, the number of persons jobless less than 5 weeks increased to 2.4 million\nand accounted for 37.0 percent of the total unemployed. The number of long-term unemployed\n(those jobless for 27 weeks or more) declined to 1.7 million. This measure is down from\n4.0 million a year earlier but is 570,000 higher than in February 2020. The long-term\nunemployed accounted for 25.9 percent of the total unemployed in January. (See table A-12.)\n\nAfter accounting for the annual adjustments to the population controls, the labor force\nparticipation rate held at 62.2 percent in January, and the employment-population ratio\nwas little changed at 59.7 percent. Both measures are up over the year but remain below\ntheir February 2020 levels (63.4 percent and 61.2 percent, respectively). (See table A-1.\nFor additional information about the effects of the population adjustments, see table C.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 3.7 million, continued\nto trend down over the month. The over-the-year decline of 2.2 million brings this measure\nto 673,000 below its February 2020 level. These individuals, who would have preferred\nfull-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been reduced or they\nwere unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was little changed\nat 5.7 million in January. This measure decreased by 1.3 million over the year but is\n708,000 higher than in February 2020. These individuals were not counted as unemployed\nbecause they were not actively looking for work during the 4 weeks preceding the survey\nor were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally\nattached to the labor force, at 1.5 million, changed little in January. These individuals\nwanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12\nmonths but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of\ndiscouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were\navailable for them, was also little changed over the month, at 408,000. (See Summary\ntable A.)\n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data\n\nIn January, the share of employed persons who teleworked because of the coronavirus\npandemic increased to 15.4 percent. These data refer to employed persons who teleworked\nor worked at home for pay at some point in the 4 weeks preceding the survey specifically\nbecause of the pandemic.\n\nIn January, 6.0 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because their\nemployer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not work at all\nor worked fewer hours at some point in the 4 weeks preceding the survey due to the\npandemic. This measure is considerably higher than the level of 3.1 million in December.\nAmong those who reported in January that they were unable to work because of pandemic-\nrelated closures or lost business, 23.7 percent received at least some pay from their\nemployer for the hours not worked, up from the prior month. \n\nAmong those not in the labor force in January, 1.8 million persons were prevented from\nlooking for work due to the pandemic, up from 1.1 million in the prior month. (To be\ncounted as unemployed, by definition, individuals must be either actively looking for\nwork or on temporary layoff.)\n\nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey beginning in\nMay 2020 to help gauge the effects of the pandemic on the labor market. The data are\nnot seasonally adjusted. Tables with estimates from the supplemental questions for all\nmonths are available online at \nwww.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 467,000 in January, compared with an\naverage monthly gain of 555,000 in 2021. Nonfarm employment has increased by 19.1 \nmillion since April 2020 but is down by 2.9 million, or 1.9 percent, from its pre-\npandemic level in February 2020. In January, employment growth continued in leisure\nand hospitality, in professional and business services, in retail trade, and in\ntransportation and warehousing. (See table B-1. See the note at the end of this news\nrelease and table A for information about the annual benchmark process.)\n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality expanded by 151,000 in January, reflecting job\ngains in food services and drinking places (+108,000) and in the accommodation industry\n(+23,000). Since February 2020, employment in leisure and hospitality is down by 1.8\nmillion, or 10.3 percent. \n\nIn January, professional and business services added 86,000 jobs. Job gains occurred\nin management and technical consulting services (+16,000), computer systems design\nand related services (+15,000), architectural and engineering services (+8,000), and\nother professional and technical services (+7,000). Employment in temporary help\nservices continued to trend up (+26,000). Employment in professional and business\nservices is 511,000 higher than in February 2020, largely in temporary help services\n(+185,000), computer systems design and related services (+161,000), and management\nand technical consulting services (+151,000).\n\nRetail trade employment rose by 61,000 in January. Job growth occurred in general\nmerchandise stores (+29,000); health and personal care stores (+11,000); sporting\ngoods, hobby, book, and music stores (+7,000); and building material and garden supply\nstores (+6,000). Retail trade employment is 61,000 above its level in February 2020.\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing increased by 54,000 in January and is \n542,000 higher than in February 2020. In January, job gains occurred in couriers and\nmessengers (+21,000), warehousing and storage (+13,000), truck transportation (+8,000),\nand air transportation (+7,000). All four of these component industries have surpassed\ntheir February 2020 employment levels, with particularly strong growth in warehousing\nand storage (+410,000) and couriers and messengers (+236,000). \n\nEmployment in local government education rose by 29,000 in January but is down by\n359,000, or 4.4 percent, since February 2020.\n\nEmployment in health care continued to trend up (+18,000) over the month but is down\nby 378,000, or 2.3 percent, from its level in February 2020. \n\nWholesale trade added 16,000 jobs in January, with gains in both durable goods (+11,000)\nand nondurable goods (+8,000). Employment in wholesale trade is 125,000, or 2.1 percent,\nlower than in February 2020.\n\nEmployment showed little change over the month in mining, construction, manufacturing,\ninformation, financial activities, and other services.   \n\nIn January, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls\nincreased by 23 cents to $31.63. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have\nincreased by 5.7 percent. In January, average hourly earnings of private-sector\nproduction and nonsupervisory employees rose by 17 cents to $26.92. (See tables B-3 and\nB-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls fell by 0.2 hour to\n34.5 hours in January. In manufacturing, the average workweek edged down by 0.1 hour to\n40.2 hours, and overtime edged up by 0.1 hour to 3.3 hours. The average workweek for\nproduction and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased by 0.2 \nhour to 33.9 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn accordance with usual practice, the seasonal adjustment models are updated as part\nof the annual benchmark process. As a result of the updates, there were some large \nrevisions to seasonally adjusted data that mostly offset each other. (See the note at\nthe end of this news release and table A for information about the revisions, the\nannual benchmark process, and the seasonal adjustment model updates.) \n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for February is scheduled to be released on Friday,\nMarch 4, 2022, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n                  Revisions to Establishment Survey Data\n\nIn accordance with annual practice, the establishment survey data released today\nhave been benchmarked to reflect comprehensive counts of payroll jobs for March\n2021. These counts are derived principally from the Quarterly Census of Employment\nand Wages (QCEW), which counts jobs covered by the Unemployment Insurance (UI) tax\nsystem. The benchmark process results in revisions to not seasonally adjusted data\nfrom April 2020 forward. Seasonally adjusted data from January 2017 forward are\nsubject to revision. In addition, data for some series prior to 2017, both\nseasonally adjusted and unadjusted, incorporate other revisions.\n\nThe total nonfarm employment level for March 2021 was revised upward by 374,000.\nOn a not seasonally adjusted basis, total nonfarm employment for March 2021 was \nrevised downward by 7,000, or less than -0.05 percent. Not seasonally adjusted, \nthe absolute average benchmark revision over the past 10 years is 0.1 percent.\n\nAs part of the benchmark process, the seasonal adjustment models are also updated.\nThese models remove normal seasonal fluctuations--such as regular employment \nchanges due to major holidays--from the data series, making it easier to observe \ncyclical and other economic trends. Now that there are more monthly observations\nrelated to the historically large job losses and gains seen in the pandemic-driven\nrecession and recovery, the models can better distinguish normal seasonal movements\nfrom underlying trends. As a result, some large revisions to seasonally adjusted\ndata occurred with the updated models; however, these monthly changes mostly offset\neach other. For example, the over-the-month employment change for November and December\n2021 combined is 709,000 higher than previously reported, while the over-the-month\nemployment change for June and July 2021 combined is 807,000 lower. Overall, the\n2021 over-the-year change is 217,000 higher than previously reported. Going forward,\nthe updated models should produce more reliable estimates of seasonal movements.\nTable A presents revised total nonfarm employment data on a seasonally adjusted\nbasis from January to December 2021.\n\nAll revised historical establishment survey data are available on the BLS website\nat www.bls.gov/ces/data/home.htm. In addition, an article that discusses the benchmark\nand post-benchmark revisions and other technical issues is available at\nwww.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesbmart.htm. \n\n\nTable A.

Population estimates for the household survey are developed by the\nU.S. Census Bureau. Each year, the Census Bureau updates the estimates to reflect new\ninformation and assumptions about the growth of the population since the previous decennial\ncensus. The change in population reflected in the new estimates results from the introduction\nof a blended 2020 population base, which combines population totals from the 2020 Census \nand demographic characteristics from other sources. It also reflects adjustments for net\ninternational migration, updated vital statistics, and estimation methodology improvements.\nThe vast majority of the population change, however, is due to the change in the base\npopulation from Census 2010 to the blended Census 2020 base.\n\nIn accordance with usual practice, BLS will not revise the official household survey estimates\nfor December 2021 and earlier months. To show the impact of the population adjustments,\nhowever, differences in selected December 2021 labor force series based on the old and new\npopulation estimates are shown in table B.\n\nThe adjustments increased the estimated size of the civilian noninstitutional population in\nDecember by 973,000, the civilian labor force by 1,530,000, employment by 1,471,000, and\nunemployment by 59,000. The number of persons not in the labor force decreased by 557,000.\nAlthough the total unemployment rate was unaffected, the employment-population ratio and\nlabor force participation rate were each increased by 0.3 percentage point. This was mostly\ndue to an increase in the size of the population in age groups that participate in the labor\nforce at high rates (those ages 35 to 64) and a large decrease in the size of the population\nage 65 and older, which participates at a low rate.\n\nData users are cautioned that these annual population adjustments can affect the comparability\nof household data series over time. Table C shows the effect of the introduction of new\npopulation estimates on the comparison of selected labor force measures between December \n2021 and January 2022. Additional information on the population adjustments and their effect\non national labor force estimates is available at \nwww.bls.gov/web/empsit/cps-pop-control-adjustments.pdf.\n\n\n\n    Table B.

Employment\ncontinued to trend up in leisure and hospitality, in professional and business services,\nin manufacturing, in construction, and in transportation and warehousing.\n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey\nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The\nestablishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry.

Seasonally \t|\n| adjusted estimates back to January 2017 were subject to revision. The unemployment \t|\n| rates for January 2021 through November 2021 (as originally published and as revised) |\n| appear in table A at the end of this news release, along with additional information\t|\n| about the revisions.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|_______________________________________________________________________________________|\n\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate declined by 0.3 percentage point to 3.9 percent in December, and the\nnumber of unemployed persons decreased by 483,000 to 6.3 million. Over the year, these \nmeasures are down by 2.8 percentage points and 4.5 million, respectively. In February 2020,\nprior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, and \nunemployed persons numbered 5.7 million. (See table A-1. See the box note at the end of \nthis news release for more information about how the household survey and its measures were\naffected by the coronavirus pandemic.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.6 percent), adult\nwomen (3.6 percent), and Whites (3.2 percent) declined in December. The jobless rates for \nteenagers (10.9 percent), Blacks (7.1 percent), Asians (3.8 percent), and Hispanics (4.9 \npercent) showed little or no change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of permanent job losers, at 1.7 million in December, \ndeclined by 202,000 over the month and is down by 1.8 million over the year. The number of\npersons on temporary layoff was little changed at 812,000 in December but is down by 2.3\nmillion over the year. The number of permanent job losers in December is 408,000 higher \nthan in February 2020, while the number on temporary layoff has essentially returned to \nits February 2020 level. (See table A-11.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) declined by \n185,000 to 2.0 million in December. This measure is down from 4.0 million a year earlier \nbut is 887,000 higher than in February 2020. The long-term unemployed accounted for 31.7 \npercent of the total unemployed in December. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate was unchanged at 61.9 percent in December but remains \n1.5 percentage points lower than in February 2020. The employment-population ratio \nincreased by 0.2 percentage point to 59.5 percent in December but is 1.7 percentage points\nbelow its February 2020 level. Over the year, these measures have increased by 0.4 \npercentage point and 2.1 percentage points, respectively. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 3.9 million in December,\ndecreased by 337,000 over the month. The over-the-year decline of 2.2 million brings this\nmeasure to 461,000 below its February 2020 level. These individuals, who would have \npreferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been \nreduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was little changed at\n5.7 million in December. This measure decreased by 1.6 million over the year but is 717,000\nhigher than in February 2020. These individuals were not counted as unemployed because they\nwere not actively looking for work during the 4 weeks preceding the survey or were \nunavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally \nattached to the labor force was essentially unchanged at 1.6 million in December. These \nindividuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the \nprior 12 months but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number\nof discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were\navailable for them, was also essentially unchanged over the month, at 463,000. (See Summary\ntable A.)\n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data\n\nIn December, the share of employed persons who teleworked because of the coronavirus \npandemic was 11.1 percent, little different from November. These data refer to employed \npersons who teleworked or worked at home for pay at some point in the 4 weeks preceding \nthe survey specifically because of the pandemic.\n\nIn December, 3.1 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because their\nemployer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not work at all \nor worked fewer hours at some point in the 4 weeks preceding the survey due to the \npandemic. This measure was down from the level of 3.6 million in November. Among those who\nreported in December that they were unable to work because of pandemic-related closures or\nlost business, 15.9 percent received at least some pay from their employer for the hours\nnot worked, little changed from the prior month.\n\nAmong those not in the labor force in December, 1.1 million persons were prevented from \nlooking for work due to the pandemic, little changed from November. (To be counted as \nunemployed, by definition, individuals must be either actively looking for work or on \ntemporary layoff.)\n\nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey beginning in\nMay 2020 to help gauge the effects of the pandemic on the labor market. The data are not\nseasonally adjusted. Tables with estimates from the supplemental questions for all months\nare available online at www.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 199,000 in December. Job growth averaged 537,000\nper month in 2021. Nonfarm employment has increased by 18.8 million since April 2020 but\nis down by 3.6 million, or 2.3 percent, from its pre-pandemic level in February 2020. In\nDecember, employment continued to trend up in leisure and hospitality, in professional \nand business services, in manufacturing, in construction, and in transportation and \nwarehousing. (See table B-1. See the box note at the end of this news release for more \ninformation about how the establishment survey and its measures were affected by the \ncoronavirus pandemic.)\n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality continued to trend up in December (+53,000). Leisure\nand hospitality has added 2.6 million jobs in 2021, but employment in the industry is down\nby 1.2 million, or 7.2 percent, since February 2020. Employment in food services and\ndrinking places rose by 43,000 in December but is down by 653,000 since February 2020.\n\nEmployment in professional and business services continued its upward trend in December \n(+43,000). Over the month, job gains occurred in computer systems design and related \nservices (+10,000), in architectural and engineering services (+9,000), and in scientific \nresearch and development services (+6,000). Employment in professional and business \nservices overall is slightly below (-35,000) its level in February 2020. \n\nManufacturing added 26,000 jobs in December, primarily in durable goods industries. A job\ngain in machinery (+8,000) reflected the return of workers from a strike. Manufacturing \nemployment is down by 219,000 since February 2020. \n\nConstruction employment rose by 22,000 in December, following monthly gains averaging \n38,000 over the prior 3 months. In December, job gains occurred in nonresidential \nspecialty trade contractors (+13,000) and in heavy and civil engineering construction \n(+10,000). Construction employment is 88,000 below its February 2020 level.\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing increased by 19,000 in December. Job gains \noccurred in support activities for transportation (+7,000), in air transportation (+6,000),\nand in warehousing and storage (+5,000). Employment in couriers and messengers was \nessentially unchanged. Since February 2020, employment in transportation and warehousing is\nup by 218,000, reflecting job growth in couriers and messengers (+202,000) and in \nwarehousing and storage (+181,000).\n\nEmployment in wholesale trade increased by 14,000 in December but is 129,000 lower than in\nFebruary 2020.\n\nMining employment rose by 7,000 in December. Employment in the industry is down by 81,000\nfrom a peak in January 2019. \n\nIn December, employment showed little or no change in other major industries, including \nretail trade, information, financial activities, health care, other services, and \ngovernment. \n\nIn December, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls \nincreased by 19 cents to $31.31. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have \nincreased by 4.7 percent. In December, average hourly earnings of private-sector \nproduction and nonsupervisory employees rose by 18 cents to $26.61. (See tables B-3\nand B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.7\nhours in December. In manufacturing, the average workweek edged down by 0.1 hour to 40.3\nhours, and overtime edged down by 0.1 hour to 3.2 hours. The average workweek for \nproduction and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged up by 0.1 hour\nto 34.2 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for October was revised up by 102,000, \nfrom +546,000 to +648,000, and the change for November was revised up by 39,000, from \n+210,000 to +249,000. With these revisions, employment in October and November combined\nis 141,000 higher than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional \nreports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published \nestimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.) \n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for January is scheduled to be released on Friday, February 4,\n2022, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|               Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on December 2021 Household                |\n|\t\t             and Establishment Survey Data             \t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Data collection for both surveys was affected by the pandemic. In the establishment \t|\n| survey, more data continued to be collected by web than in months prior to the \t|\n| pandemic. In the household survey, for the safety of both interviewers and \t\t|\n| respondents, in-person interviews were conducted only when telephone interviews could |\n| not be done. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| As in previous months, some workers affected by the pandemic who should have been \t|\n| classified in the household survey as unemployed on temporary layoff were instead \t|\n| misclassified as employed but not at work. Since March 2020, BLS has published an \t|\n| upper-bound estimate of what the unemployment rate might have been had misclassified  |\n| workers been included among the unemployed. The degree of misclassification was \t|\n| highest in the early months of the pandemic and has been considerably lower in recent |\n| months. In April 2020, this exercise suggested the unemployment rate would have been  |\n| 4.8 percentage points higher than reported. Repeating this exercise, the unemployment |\n| rates for October 2021 through December 2021 would have been 0.1 percentage point \t|\n| higher than reported.

Notable job gains occurred in professional and business services, transportation\nand warehousing, construction, and manufacturing. Employment in retail trade declined over\nthe month.\n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey measures\nlabor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The establishment\nsurvey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. For more information\nabout the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two surveys, see the Technical\nNote.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 4.2 percent in November. The number\nof unemployed persons fell by 542,000 to 6.9 million. Both measures are down considerably\nfrom their highs at the end of the February-April 2020 recession. However, they remain above\ntheir levels prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (3.5 percent and 5.7 million,\nrespectively, in February 2020). (See table A-1. See the box note at the end of this news\nrelease for more information about how the household survey and its measures were affected\nby the coronavirus pandemic.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (4.0 percent), adult\nwomen (4.0 percent), Whites (3.7 percent), Blacks (6.7 percent), and Hispanics (5.2 percent)\ndeclined in November. The jobless rates for teenagers (11.2 percent) and Asians (3.8 percent)\nshowed little change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of permanent job losers declined by 205,000 to 1.9 million\nin November but is 623,000 higher than in February 2020. The number of persons on temporary\nlayoff decreased by 255,000 to 801,000 in November. This measure is down from the high of\n18.0 million in April 2020 and has nearly returned to its February 2020 level of 750,000.\n(See table A-11.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more), at 2.2 million,\nchanged little in November but is 1.1 million higher than in February 2020. The long-term\nunemployed accounted for 32.1 percent of the total unemployed in November. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate edged up to 61.8 percent in November. The participation\nrate is 1.5 percentage points lower than in February 2020. The employment-population ratio\nincreased by 0.4 percentage point to 59.2 percent in November. This measure is up from its\nlow of 51.3 percent in April 2020 but remains below the figure of 61.1 percent in February\n2020. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 4.3 million, changed\nlittle in November. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment,\nwere working part time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find\nfull-time jobs. This figure was about the same as in February 2020. (See table A-8.)\n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was 5.9 million in \nNovember, little changed over the month but up by 849,000 since February 2020. These\nindividuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for\nwork during the 4 weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take a job. (See \ntable A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally \nattached to the labor force was little changed at 1.6 million in November. These individuals\nwanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12\nmonths but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of\ndiscouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were\navailable for them, was essentially unchanged over the month at 450,000. (See Summary\ntable A.)\n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data\n\nIn November, the share of employed persons who teleworked because of the coronavirus\npandemic declined by 0.3 percentage point to 11.3 percent. These data refer to employed\npersons who teleworked or worked at home for pay at some point in the 4 weeks preceding\nthe survey specifically because of the pandemic.\n\nIn November, 3.6 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because their\nemployer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not work at all\nor worked fewer hours at some point in the 4 weeks preceding the survey due to the pandemic.\nThis measure was little different from the level of 3.8 million in October. Among those\nwho reported in November that they were unable to work because of pandemic-related closures\nor lost business, 15.8 percent received at least some pay from their employer for the \nhours not worked, little changed from the prior month.\n\nAmong those not in the labor force in November, 1.2 million persons were prevented from\nlooking for work due to the pandemic, little changed from October. (To be counted as\nunemployed, by definition, individuals must be either actively looking for work or on\ntemporary layoff.)\n\nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey beginning in\nMay 2020 to help gauge the effects of the pandemic on the labor market. The data are not\nseasonally adjusted. Tables with estimates from the supplemental questions for all months\nare available online at www.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 210,000 in November. Thus far this year, monthly\njob growth has averaged 555,000. Nonfarm employment has increased by 18.5 million since\nApril 2020 but is down by 3.9 million, or 2.6 percent, from its pre-pandemic level in\nFebruary 2020. In November, notable job gains occurred in professional and business\nservices, transportation and warehousing, construction, and manufacturing. Employment\nin retail trade declined over the month. (See table B-1. See the box note at the end of\nthis news release for more information about how the establishment survey and its measures\nwere affected by the coronavirus pandemic.)\n\nProfessional and business services added 90,000 jobs in November. Job gains continued in\nadministrative and waste services (+42,000), although employment in its temporary help\nservices component changed little (+6,000). Job growth also continued in management and\ntechnical consulting services (+12,000) and in computer system design and related services\n(+10,000). Employment in professional and business services overall is 69,000 below its\nlevel in February 2020.\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing increased by 50,000 in November and is 210,000\nabove its February 2020 level. In November, job gains occurred in couriers and messengers\n(+27,000) and in warehousing and storage (+9,000).\n\nConstruction employment rose by 31,000 in November, following gains of a similar magnitude\nin the prior 2 months. In November, employment continued to trend up in specialty trade\ncontractors (+13,000), construction of buildings (+10,000), and heavy and civil engineering\nconstruction (+8,000). Construction employment is 115,000 below its February 2020 level. \n\nManufacturing added 31,000 jobs in November. Job gains occurred in miscellaneous durable\ngoods manufacturing (+10,000) and fabricated metal products (+8,000), while motor vehicles\nand parts lost jobs (-10,000). Employment in machinery declined by 6,000, largely reflecting\na strike. Manufacturing employment is down by 253,000 since February 2020.\n\nEmployment in financial activities continued to trend up in November (+13,000) and is\n30,000 above its February 2020 level. Job growth occurred in securities, commodity contracts,\nand investments in November (+9,000). \n\nEmployment in retail trade declined by 20,000 in November, with job losses in general \nmerchandise stores (-20,000); clothing and clothing accessories stores (-18,000); and \nsporting goods, hobby, book, and music stores (-9,000). These losses were partially offset\nby job gains in food and beverage stores (+9,000) and in building material and garden \nsupply stores (+7,000). Retail trade employment is 176,000 lower than in February 2020.\n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality changed little in November (+23,000), following \nlarge gains earlier in the year. Leisure and hospitality has added 2.4 million jobs thus\nfar in 2021, but employment in the industry is down by 1.3 million, or 7.9 percent, since\nFebruary 2020.\n\nHealth care employment was about unchanged in November (+2,000). Within the industry,\nemployment in ambulatory health care services continued to trend up (+17,000), while\nnursing and residential care facilities lost 11,000 jobs. Employment in health care is\ndown by 450,000 since February 2020, with nursing and residential care facilities\naccounting for nearly all of the loss. \n\nIn November, employment showed little change in other major industries, including mining,\nwholesale trade, information, other services, and public and private education. \n\nIn November, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls\nincreased by 8 cents to $31.03. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have\nincreased by 4.8 percent. In November, average hourly earnings of private-sector \nproduction and nonsupervisory employees rose by 12 cents to $26.40. (See tables B-3 and\nB-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.1 hour\nto 34.8 hours in November. In manufacturing, the average workweek edged up by 0.1 hour\nto 40.4 hours, and overtime was unchanged at 3.2 hours. The average workweek for\nproduction and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at\n34.1 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for September was revised up by 67,000,\nfrom +312,000 to +379,000, and the change for October was revised up by 15,000, from\n+531,000 to +546,000.

Job growth was widespread, with notable job gains in leisure and \nhospitality, in professional and business services, in manufacturing, and in \ntransportation and warehousing. Employment in public education declined over the month. \n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey \nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The\nestablishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. For\nmore information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two surveys,\nsee the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate edged down to 4.6 percent in October. The number of unemployed \npersons, at 7.4 million, continued to trend down. Both measures are down considerably\nfrom their highs at the end of the February-April 2020 recession. However, they remain \nabove their levels prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (3.5 percent and 5.7 \nmillion, respectively, in February 2020). (See table A-1. See the box note at the end\nof this news release for more information about how the household survey and its measures\nwere affected by the coronavirus pandemic.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for adult men (4.3 percent) declined\nin October. The jobless rates for adult women (4.4 percent), teenagers (11.9 percent),\nWhites (4.0 percent), Blacks (7.9 percent), Asians (4.2 percent), and Hispanics (5.9 \npercent) showed little or no change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of permanent job losers, at 2.1 million, changed little\nin October but is 828,000 higher than in February 2020. The number of persons on temporary\nlayoff, at 1.1 million, was little changed over the month. This measure is down \nconsiderably from the high of 18.0 million in April 2020 but is 306,000 above the February\n2020 level. (See table A-11.)\n\nIn October, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) \ndecreased by 357,000 to 2.3 million but is 1.2 million higher than in February 2020. The \nlong-term unemployed accounted for 31.6 percent of the total unemployed in October. \n(See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate was unchanged at 61.6 percent in October and has \nremained within a narrow range of 61.4 percent to 61.7 percent since June 2020. The \nparticipation rate is 1.7 percentage points lower than in February 2020. The employment-\npopulation ratio, at 58.8 percent, was little changed over the month. This measure is up\nfrom its low of 51.3 percent in April 2020 but remains below the figure of 61.1 percent in\nFebruary 2020. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 4.4 million, was little\nchanged in October. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were\nworking part time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-\ntime jobs. This measure has essentially returned to its February 2020 level. (See table A-8.)\n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was 6.0 million in \nOctober, essentially unchanged over the month but up by 968,000 since February 2020. These\nindividuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work\nduring the 4 weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally \nattached to the labor force was little changed at 1.7 million in October. These individuals\nwanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 \nmonths but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of \ndiscouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were \navailable for them, was essentially unchanged over the month at 455,000. (See Summary\ntable A.)\n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data\n\nIn October, 11.6 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus pandemic,\ndown from 13.2 percent in the prior month. These data refer to employed persons who \nteleworked or worked at home for pay at some point in the 4 weeks preceding the survey \nspecifically because of the pandemic.\n\nIn October, 3.8 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because their \nemployer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not work at all or\nworked fewer hours at some point in the 4 weeks preceding the survey due to the pandemic. \nThis measure is down from 5.0 million in September. Among those who reported in October that\nthey were unable to work because of pandemic-related closures or lost business, 13.3 percent\nreceived at least some pay from their employer for the hours not worked, little changed from\nthe prior month.\n\nAmong those not in the labor force in October, 1.3 million persons were prevented from \nlooking for work due to the pandemic. This measure is down from 1.6 million in September. \n(To be counted as unemployed, by definition, individuals must be either actively looking for\nwork or on temporary layoff.)\n\nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey beginning in May \n2020 to help gauge the effects of the pandemic on the labor market. The data are not \nseasonally adjusted. Tables with estimates from the supplemental questions for all months \nare available online at www.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 531,000 in October. Thus far this year, monthly job\ngrowth has averaged 582,000. Nonfarm employment has increased by 18.2 million since a recent\ntrough in April 2020 but is down by 4.2 million, or 2.8 percent, from its pre-pandemic level\nin February 2020. Job growth was widespread in October, with notable job gains occurring in\nleisure and hospitality, in professional and business services, in manufacturing, and in \ntransportation and warehousing. Employment in public education declined over the month. (See\ntable B-1. See the box note at the end of this news release for more information about how\nthe establishment survey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic.)\n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality increased by 164,000 in October and has risen by 2.4\nmillion thus far in 2021. Over the month, employment rose by 119,000 in food services and \ndrinking places and by 23,000 in accommodation. Employment in leisure and hospitality is \ndown by 1.4 million, or 8.2 percent, since February 2020.\n\nProfessional and business services added 100,000 jobs in October, including a gain of 41,000\nin temporary help services. Employment continued to rise in management and technical \nconsulting services (+14,000), other professional and technical services (+9,000), \nscientific research and development services (+6,000), and legal services (+5,000). \nEmployment in professional and business services is 215,000 below its level in February 2020.\n\nEmployment in manufacturing increased by 60,000 in October, led by a gain in motor vehicles \nand parts (+28,000). Employment also rose in fabricated metal products (+6,000), chemicals \n(+6,000), and printing and related support activities (+4,000). Manufacturing employment is \ndown by 270,000 since February 2020.\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing increased by 54,000 in October and is 149,000 \nabove its February 2020 level. In October, job gains occurred in warehousing and storage \n(+20,000), transit and ground passenger transportation (+16,000), air transportation (+9,000),\nand truck transportation (+8,000). Employment in couriers and messengers decreased by 5,000\nin October, after increasing in the prior 3 months. \n\nConstruction employment rose by 44,000 in October, following an increase of 30,000 in \nSeptember. In October, employment increased in nonresidential specialty trade contractors \n(+19,000) and in heavy and civil engineering construction (+12,000). Construction employment\nis 150,000 below its February 2020 level.\n\nHealth care added 37,000 jobs in October, with most of the gain occurring in home health \ncare services (+16,000) and nursing care facilities (+12,000). Employment in health care is \ndown by 460,000 since February 2020.\n\nIn October, employment in retail trade rose by 35,000. Employment gains occurred in food and\nbeverage stores (+16,000), general merchandise stores (+15,000), health and personal care\nstores (+8,000), and electronics and appliance stores (+6,000). These gains were partially \noffset by a job loss in building material and garden supply stores (-10,000). Retail trade \nemployment is 140,000 lower than its level in February 2020.\n\nEmployment in the other services industry increased by 33,000 in October, as personal and\nlaundry services added 28,000 jobs. Employment in other services is 169,000 below its \nFebruary 2020 level. \n\nEmployment in financial activities rose by 21,000 in October and has returned to its \nFebruary 2020 level. Over the month, job growth occurred in real estate and rental and \nleasing (+12,000) and in securities, commodity contracts, and investments (+11,000). \n\nEmployment in wholesale trade increased by 14,000 in October, reflecting a gain in the\ndurable goods component. Employment in wholesale trade is 158,000 lower than in February\n2020.\n\nMining employment continued to trend up in October (+5,000) but is down by 87,000 from a \npeak in January 2019. \n\nIn October, employment decreased in local government education and state government \neducation (-43,000 and -22,000, respectively). Employment changed little in private \neducation (+17,000). Recent employment changes in public and private education are \nchallenging to interpret, as pandemic-related staffing fluctuations have distorted the normal\nseasonal hiring and layoff patterns. Since February 2020, employment is down by 370,000 in\nlocal government education, by 205,000 in state government education, and by 148,000 in \nprivate education.\n\nEmployment in information changed little in October (+10,000) but is 122,000 lower than in \nFebruary 2020. \n\nIn October, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased\nby 11 cents to $30.96, following large increases in the prior 6 months. Over the past 12 \nmonths, average hourly earnings have increased by 4.9 percent. In October, average hourly \nearnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees rose by 10 cents to \n$26.26. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased by 0.1 hour to\n34.7 hours. In manufacturing, the average workweek edged down by 0.1 hour to 40.3 hours, and\novertime edged down by 0.1 hour to 3.2 hours. The average workweek for production and \nnonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased by 0.1 hour to 34.1 hours. \n(See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for August was revised up by 117,000, from \n+366,000 to +483,000, and the change for September was revised up by 118,000, from +194,000\nto +312,000. With these revisions, employment in August and September combined is 235,000 \nhigher than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received\nfrom businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the \nrecalculation of seasonal factors.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for November is scheduled to be released on Friday, December 3, \n2021, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|                Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on October 2021 Household                |\n|\t\t\t      and Establishment Survey Data\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Data collection for both surveys was affected by the pandemic.

For more information\nabout the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two surveys, see the Technical\nNote.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 4.8 percent in September. The number\nof unemployed persons fell by 710,000 to 7.7 million. Both measures are down considerably\nfrom their highs at the end of the February-April 2020 recession. However, they remain\nabove their levels prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (3.5 percent and 5.7 million,\nrespectively, in February 2020). (See table A-1. See the box note at the end of this news release\nfor more information about how the household survey and its measures were affected by the\ncoronavirus pandemic.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (4.7 percent), adult\nwomen (4.2 percent), Whites (4.2 percent), and Blacks (7.9 percent) declined in September. \nThe jobless rates for teenagers (11.5 percent), Asians (4.2 percent), and Hispanics (6.3 \npercent) showed little change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of permanent job losers declined by 236,000 to 2.3 million\nin September but is 953,000 higher than in February 2020. The number of persons on temporary\nlayoff, at 1.1 million, changed little in September. This measure is down considerably from\nthe high of 18.0 million in April 2020 but is 374,000 above the February 2020 level. The\nnumber of reentrants to the labor force decreased by 198,000 in September to 2.3 million,\nafter increasing by a similar amount in August. (Reentrants are persons who previously worked\nbut were not in the labor force prior to beginning their job search.) (See table A-11.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) decreased by 496,000\nin September to 2.7 million but is 1.6 million higher than in February 2020. The long-term \nunemployed accounted for 34.5 percent of the total unemployed in September. The number of\npersons jobless less than 5 weeks, at 2.2 million, changed little. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate was little changed at 61.6 percent in September and has\nremained within a narrow range of 61.4 percent to 61.7 percent since June 2020. The \nparticipation rate is 1.7 percentage points lower than in February 2020. The employment-\npopulation ratio, at 58.7 percent, edged up in September. This measure is up from its low\nof 51.3 percent in April 2020 but remains below the figure of 61.1 percent in February 2020.\n(See table A-1.)\n\nIn September, the number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 4.5 million,\nwas essentially unchanged for the second month in a row. There were 4.4 million persons in\nthis category in February 2020. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time\nemployment, were working part time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable\nto find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was 6.0 million in\nSeptember, little changed over the month but up by 959,000 since February 2020. These\nindividuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work \nduring the last 4 weeks or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.) \n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally \nattached to the labor force edged up to 1.7 million in September, following a decline in \nthe prior month.

Thus far this year, monthly\njob growth has averaged 561,000. Nonfarm employment has increased by 17.4 million since a\nrecent trough in April 2020 but is down by 5.0 million, or 3.3 percent, from its pre-pandemic\nlevel in February 2020. In September, notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality,\nin professional and business services, in retail trade, and in transportation and warehousing.\nEmployment in public education declined over the month. (See table B-1. See the box note at the\nend of this news release for more information about how the establishment survey and its measures\nwere affected by the coronavirus pandemic.)\n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality increased by 74,000 in September, with continued job growth\nin arts, entertainment, and recreation (+43,000). Employment in food services and drinking places\nchanged little for the second consecutive month, compared with an average monthly gain of 197,000 \nfrom January through July. Employment in leisure and hospitality is down by 1.6 million, or 9.4\npercent, since February 2020.\n\nProfessional and business services added 60,000 jobs in September. Employment continued to increase\nin architectural and engineering services (+15,000), management and technical consulting services\n(+15,000), and computer systems design and related services (+9,000). Employment in professional\nand business services is 385,000 below its level in February 2020.\n\nIn September, employment in retail trade rose by 56,000, following 2 months of little change. Over\nthe month, employment gains occurred in clothing and clothing accessories stores (+27,000), general\nmerchandise stores (+16,000), and building material and garden supply stores (+16,000). These\ngains were partially offset by a loss in food and beverage stores (-12,000). Retail trade employment\nis 202,000 lower than its level in February 2020.\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing increased by 47,000 in September, in line with gains\nin the prior 2 months. In September, job gains continued in warehousing and storage (+16,000),\ncouriers and messengers (+13,000), and air transportation (+10,000). Employment in transportation\nand warehousing is 72,000 above its pre-pandemic level in February 2020.\n\nEmployment in the information industry increased by 32,000 in September. Gains occurred in motion\npicture and sound recording industries (+14,000); in publishing industries, except Internet (+11,000);\nand in data processing, hosting, and related services (+6,000). Employment in information is down\nby 108,000 since February 2020.\n\nIn September, social assistance added 30,000 jobs, led by a gain in child day care services (+18,000).\nEmployment in social assistance is 204,000 lower than in February 2020.\n\nEmployment in manufacturing increased by 26,000 in September, with gains in fabricated metal products\n(+8,000), machinery (+6,000), and printing and related support activities (+4,000). These gains \nwere partially offset by a decline of 6,000 in motor vehicles and parts. Manufacturing employment\nis down by 353,000 since February 2020.\n\nConstruction employment rose by 22,000 in September but has shown little net change thus far this\nyear. Employment in construction is 201,000 below its February 2020 level.\n\nIn September, employment in wholesale trade increased by 17,000, almost entirely in the durable goods\ncomponent (+16,000). Employment in wholesale trade is down by 159,000 since February 2020.\n\nMining employment continued to trend up in September (+5,000), reflecting growth in support activities\nfor mining (+4,000). Mining employment has risen by 59,000 since a trough in August 2020 but is 93,000\nbelow a peak in January 2019.\n\nIn September, employment decreased by 144,000 in local government education and by 17,000 in state \ngovernment education. Employment changed little in private education (-19,000). Most back-to-school\nhiring typically occurs in September. Hiring this September was lower than usual, resulting in a \ndecline after seasonal adjustment. Recent employment changes are challenging to interpret, as pandemic-\nrelated staffing fluctuations in public and private education have distorted the normal seasonal \nhiring and layoff patterns. Since February 2020, employment is down by 310,000 in local government \neducation, by 194,000 in state government education, and by 172,000 in private education.\n\nEmployment in health care changed little in September (-18,000). Job losses occurred in nursing and\nresidential care facilities (-38,000) and hospitals (-8,000), while ambulatory health care services\nadded jobs (+28,000). Employment in health care is down by 524,000 since February 2020, with nursing\nand residential care facilities accounting for about four-fifths of the loss.  \n\nIn September, employment showed little change in financial activities and in other services.\n\nAverage hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 19 cents to $30.85 in\nSeptember, following large increases in the prior 5 months. In September, average hourly earnings\nof private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees rose by 14 cents to $26.15. The data for\nrecent months suggest that the rising demand for labor associated with the recovery from the\npandemic may have put upward pressure on wages. However, because average hourly earnings vary \nwidely across industries, the large employment fluctuations since February 2020 complicate the\nanalysis of recent trends in average hourly earnings. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nIn September, the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.2\nhour to 34.8 hours. In manufacturing, the average workweek was unchanged at 40.4 hours, and overtime\nedged up by 0.1 hour to 3.3 hours. The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees\non private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.1 hour to 34.2 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for July was revised up by 38,000, from +1,053,000 to\n+1,091,000, and the change for August was revised up by 131,000, from +235,000 to +366,000. With \nthese revisions, employment in July and August combined is 169,000 higher than previously reported.\n(Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies\nsince the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for October is scheduled to be released on Friday, November 5, 2021,\nat 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n  ___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     |\n |                   Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on September 2021 Household and                   | \n |                                     Establishment Survey Data\t\t\t\t     |\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     |\n |   Data collection for both surveys was affected by the pandemic.

So far this year, monthly job growth has averaged 586,000. In August, \nnotable job gains occurred in professional and business services, transportation and \nwarehousing, private education, manufacturing, and other services. Employment in retail\ntrade declined over the month. \n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey \nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The\nestablishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. For more\ninformation about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two surveys, see\nthe Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate declined by 0.2 percentage point to 5.2 percent in August. The number\nof unemployed persons edged down to 8.4 million, following a large decrease in July. Both\nmeasures are down considerably from their highs at the end of the February-April 2020 \nrecession. However, they remain above their levels prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) \npandemic (3.5 percent and 5.7 million, respectively, in February 2020). (See table A-1. \nSee the box note at the end of this news release for more information about how the \nhousehold survey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic.) \n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (5.1 percent) and \nWhites (4.5 percent) declined in August, while the rate for teenagers (11.2 percent) \nincreased. The jobless rates for adult women (4.8 percent), Blacks (8.8 percent), Asians\n(4.6 percent), and Hispanics (6.4 percent) showed little change over the month. (See \ntables A-1, A-2, and A-3.) \n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of permanent job losers declined by 443,000 to 2.5 \nmillion in August but is 1.2 million higher than in February 2020. The number of persons \non temporary layoff, at 1.3 million, was essentially unchanged in August. This measure is\ndown considerably from the high of 18.0 million in April 2020 but is 502,000 above the \nFebruary 2020 level. The number of reentrants to the labor force increased by 200,000 in \nAugust to 2.5 million. (Reentrants are persons who previously worked but were not in the\nlabor force prior to beginning their job search.) (See table A-11.) \n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) decreased by \n246,000 in August to 3.2 million but is 2.1 million higher than in February 2020. These \nlong-term unemployed accounted for 37.4 percent of the total unemployed in August. The \nnumber of persons jobless less than 5 weeks, at 2.1 million, was little changed. \n(See table A-12.) \n\nThe labor force participation rate, at 61.7 percent in August, was unchanged over the \nmonth and has remained within a narrow range of 61.4 percent to 61.7 percent since June \n2020. The participation rate is 1.6 percentage points lower than in February 2020. The \nemployment-population ratio, at 58.5 percent, was little changed in August. This measure \nis up from its low of 51.3 percent in April 2020 but remains below the figure of 61.1 \npercent in February 2020. (See table A-1.) \n\nIn August, the number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 4.5 million,\nwas essentially unchanged. There were 4.4 million persons in this category in February \n2020. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part\ntime because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. \n(See table A-8.) \n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job declined by 835,000\nin August to 5.7 million but remains higher than the level in February 2020 (5.0 million).\nThese individuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking \nfor work during the last 4 weeks or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.) \n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally \nattached to the labor force, at 1.6 million in August, decreased by 295,000 over the \nmonth. These individuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job \nsometime in the prior 12 months but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the\nsurvey. The number of discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who \nbelieved that no jobs were available for them, was 392,000 in August, down by 115,000 from\nthe previous month. (See Summary table A.) \n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data \n\nIn August, 13.4 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus \npandemic, little changed from the prior month. These data refer to employed persons who\nteleworked or worked at home for pay at some point in the last 4 weeks specifically \nbecause of the pandemic. \n\nIn August, 5.6 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because their\nemployer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not work at all \nor worked fewer hours at some point in the last 4 weeks due to the pandemic. This measure\nis up from 5.2 million in July. Among those who reported in August that they were unable \nto work because of pandemic-related closures or lost business, 13.9 percent received at \nleast some pay from their employer for the hours not worked, up from 9.1 percent in the \nprior month. \n\nAmong those not in the labor force in August, 1.5 million persons were prevented from \nlooking for work due to the pandemic, little changed from July. (To be counted as \nunemployed, by definition, individuals must be either actively looking for work or on \ntemporary layoff.) \n\nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey beginning in \nMay 2020 to help gauge the effects of the pandemic on the labor market. The data are not\nseasonally adjusted. Tables with estimates from the supplemental questions for all months\nare available online at www.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 235,000 in August, following increases of 1.1 \nmillion in July and 962,000 in June. Nonfarm employment has risen by 17.0 million since\nApril 2020 but is down by 5.3 million, or 3.5 percent, from its pre-pandemic level in \nFebruary 2020. In August, notable job gains occurred in professional and business \nservices, transportation and warehousing, private education, manufacturing, and other \nservices. Employment in retail trade declined over the month. (See table B-1. See the box\nnote at the end of this news release for more information about how the establishment \nsurvey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic.) \n\nEmployment in professional and business services increased by 74,000 in August. Employment\nrose in architectural and engineering services (+19,000), computer systems design and \nrelated services (+10,000), scientific research and development services (+7,000), and \noffice administrative services (+6,000). Since February 2020, employment in professional \nand business services is down by 468,000, over half of which is in temporary help services\n(-262,000). \n\nTransportation and warehousing added 53,000 jobs in August, bringing employment in the \nindustry slightly above (+22,000) its pre-pandemic level in February 2020. Employment gains\nhave been led by strong growth in couriers and messengers and in warehousing and storage,\nwhich added 20,000 jobs each in August. Air transportation also added jobs (+11,000), while\ntransit and ground passenger transportation--which includes school buses--lost jobs (-8,000).\n\nIn August, employment increased by 40,000 in private education, declined by 21,000 in state\ngovernment education, and changed little in local government education (-6,000). In all \nthree industries, these employment changes followed job gains in June and July. August marks\nthe beginning of the traditional back-to-school season. However, recent employment changes \nare challenging to interpret, as pandemic-related staffing fluctuations in public and \nprivate education have distorted the normal seasonal hiring and layoff patterns. Since \nFebruary 2020, employment is down by 159,000 in private education, by 186,000 in state \ngovernment education, and by 220,000 in local government education.\n\nManufacturing added 37,000 jobs in August, with gains in motor vehicles and parts (+24,000)\nand fabricated metal products (+7,000). Employment in manufacturing is down by 378,000 from\nits pre-pandemic level in February 2020.\n\nThe other services industry added 37,000 jobs in August, but employment is 189,000 lower \nthan in February 2020. In August, employment rose in personal and laundry services \n(+19,000) and in repair and maintenance (+9,000). \n\nEmployment in information increased by 17,000 in August, reflecting a gain in data \nprocessing, hosting, and related services (+12,000). Employment in information is down by\n150,000 since February 2020.  \n\nEmployment in financial activities rose by 16,000 over the month, with most of the gain\noccurring in real estate (+11,000). Employment in financial activities is down by 29,000\nsince February 2020. \n\nMining added 6,000 jobs in August, reflecting a gain in support activities for mining \n(+4,000). Mining employment has risen by 55,000 since a trough in August 2020 but is \n96,000 below a peak in January 2019.\n\nEmployment in retail trade declined by 29,000 in August, with losses in food and beverage\nstores (-23,000) and in building material and garden supply stores (-13,000). Retail trade\nemployment is down by 285,000 since February 2020.\n\nIn August, employment in leisure and hospitality was unchanged, after increasing by an \naverage of 350,000 per month over the prior 6 months. In August, a job gain in arts, \nentertainment, and recreation (+36,000) was more than offset by a loss in food services \nand drinking places (-42,000). Employment in leisure and hospitality is down by 1.7 \nmillion, or 10.0 percent, since February 2020.\n\nIn August, employment showed little change in other major industries, including \nconstruction, wholesale trade, and health care. \n\nAverage hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 17 cents to\n$30.73 in August, following increases in the prior 4 months. In August, average hourly\nearnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees rose by 14 cents to \n$25.99. The data for recent months suggest that the rising demand for labor associated \nwith the recovery from the pandemic may have put upward pressure on wages. However, \nbecause average hourly earnings vary widely across industries, the large employment \nfluctuations since February 2020 complicate the analysis of recent trends in average \nhourly earnings. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nIn August, the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was 34.7 \nhours for the third consecutive month. In manufacturing, the average workweek fell by 0.2\nhour over the month to 40.3 hours, and overtime remained at 3.2 hours. The average \nworkweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was \nunchanged at 34.2 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for June was revised up by 24,000, from \n+938,000 to +962,000, and the change for July was revised up by 110,000, from +943,000 \nto +1,053,000. With these revisions, employment in June and July combined is 134,000 \nhigher than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports \nreceived from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and\nfrom the recalculation of seasonal factors.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for September is scheduled to be released on Friday, October 8,\n2021, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|              Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on August 2021 Household and               |\n|                                Establishment Survey Data                              |\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Data collection for both surveys was affected by the pandemic.

Nonfarm payroll employment in July is up by 16.7 million since April 2020\nbut is down by 5.7 million, or 3.7 percent, from its pre-pandemic level in February 2020.\nIn July, notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, in local government \neducation, and in professional and business services. (See table B-1. See the box note at\nthe end of this news release for more information about how the establishment survey and \nits measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic.)\n\nIn July, employment in leisure and hospitality increased by 380,000. Two-thirds of the job\ngain was in food services and drinking places (+253,000). Employment also continued to \nincrease in accommodation (+74,000) and in arts, entertainment, and recreation (+53,000).\nDespite recent growth, employment in leisure and hospitality is down by 1.7 million, or \n10.3 percent, from its level in February 2020. \n\nIn July, employment rose by 221,000 in local government education and by 40,000 in private\neducation. Staffing fluctuations in education due to the pandemic have distorted the \nnormal seasonal buildup and layoff patterns, likely contributing to the job gains in July.\nWithout the typical seasonal employment increases earlier, there were fewer layoffs at the\nend of the school year, resulting in job gains after seasonal adjustment. These variations\nmake it more challenging to discern the current employment trends in these education \nindustries. Since February 2020, employment is down by 205,000 in local government\neducation and 207,000 in private education.\n\nEmployment in professional and business services rose by 60,000 in July. Within the \nindustry, employment in the professional and technical services component rose by 43,000 \nover the month and is 121,000 above its February 2020 level. (Professional and technical \nservices includes industries such as accounting and bookkeeping services, management and \ntechnical consulting services, and scientific research and development services.) By \ncontrast, employment in the administrative and waste services component (which includes \ntemporary help services) changed little over the month (+20,000) and is 577,000 lower than\nin February 2020. Employment in the management of companies and enterprises component was\nalso little changed over the month (-3,000) but is 100,000 lower than the level in \nFebruary 2020. Employment in professional and business services overall is down by 556,000\nsince February 2020. \n\nTransportation and warehousing added 50,000 jobs in July. Job growth occurred in transit\nand ground passenger transportation (+19,000), warehousing and storage (+11,000), and \ncouriers and messengers (+8,000). Employment in transportation and warehousing has grown \nby 534,000 since April 2020; the industry has recovered 92.9 percent of the jobs lost \nduring the February-April 2020 recession (-575,000).\n\nThe other services industry added 39,000 jobs in July, with gains in membership \nassociations and organizations (+17,000) and in personal and laundry services (+15,000). \nEmployment in other services is 236,000 lower than in February 2020.\n\nHealth care added 37,000 jobs in July. Job gains in ambulatory health care services \n(+32,000) and hospitals (+18,000) more than offset a loss of 13,000 jobs in nursing and \nresidential care facilities. Health care employment is down by 502,000 since February 2020.\n\nEmployment in manufacturing increased by 27,000 in July, largely in durable goods \nmanufacturing. Within durable goods, job gains occurred in machinery (+7,000) and\nmiscellaneous durable goods manufacturing (+6,000). Manufacturing employment is 433,000 \nbelow its February 2020 level. \n\nEmployment in information increased by 24,000 over the month, with three-quarters of the \ngain in motion picture and sound recording industries (+18,000). Employment in information\nis down by 172,000 since February 2020. \n\nEmployment in financial activities rose by 22,000 over the month, largely in real estate \nand rental and leasing (+18,000). Employment in financial activities is down by 48,000 \nsince February 2020. \n\nEmployment in mining increased by 7,000 in July, reflecting a gain in support activities\nfor mining (+6,000). Mining employment has risen by 49,000 since a trough in August 2020\nbut is 103,000 below a peak in January 2019.\n\nEmployment in retail trade changed little in July (-6,000), following large increases in\nthe prior 2 months. In July, job gains in gasoline stations (+14,000), miscellaneous \nstore retailers (+7,000), and nonstore retailers (+5,000) were more than offset by a loss\nin building material and garden supply stores (-34,000). Since February 2020, employment\nin retail trade is down by 270,000.\n\nIn July, employment showed little change in construction and wholesale trade.\n\nIn July, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased\nby 11 cents to $30.54, following increases in the prior 3 months. Average hourly earnings\nfor private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees also rose by 11 cents in July\nto $25.83. The data for recent months suggest that the rising demand for labor associated\nwith the recovery from the pandemic may have put upward pressure on wages. However, \nbecause average hourly earnings vary widely across industries, the large employment \nfluctuations since February 2020 complicate the analysis of recent trends in average \nhourly earnings. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nIn July, the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged\nat 34.8 hours. In manufacturing, the average workweek increased by 0.2 hour to 40.5 \nhours, and overtime was unchanged at 3.2 hours. The average workweek for production and \nnonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.2 hours. \n(See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for May was revised up by 31,000, from\n+583,000 to +614,000, and the change for June was revised up by 88,000, from +850,000 to\n+938,000. With these revisions, employment in May and June combined is 119,000 higher \nthan previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from\nbusinesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the \nrecalculation of seasonal factors.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for August is scheduled to be released on Friday, September 3,\n2021, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|               Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on July 2021 Household and                |\n| \t\t\t\tEstablishment Survey Data\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Data collection for both surveys was affected by the pandemic.

Notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, public\nand private education, professional and business services, retail trade, and\nother services.\n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household\nsurvey measures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic\ncharacteristics. The establishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours,\nand earnings by industry. For more information about the concepts and statistical\nmethodology used in these two surveys, see the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nBoth the unemployment rate, at 5.9 percent, and the number of unemployed persons,\nat 9.5 million, were little changed in June. These measures are down considerably\nfrom their recent highs in April 2020 but remain well above their levels prior\nto the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (3.5 percent and 5.7 million, respectively,\nin February 2020). (See table A-1. See the box note at the end of this news release\nfor more information about how the household survey and its measures were affected\nby the coronavirus pandemic.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (5.9 percent),\nadult women (5.5 percent), teenagers (9.9 percent), Whites (5.2 percent), Blacks\n(9.2 percent), Asians (5.8 percent), and Hispanics (7.4 percent) showed little\nor no change in June. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of job leavers--that is, unemployed persons who\nquit or voluntarily left their previous job and began looking for new employment--\nincreased by 164,000 to 942,000 in June. The number of persons on temporary layoff,\nat 1.8 million, was essentially unchanged over the month. This measure is down\nconsiderably from the high of 18.0 million in April 2020 but is 1.1 million above\nthe February 2020 level. The number of permanent job losers, at 3.2 million, was\nalso essentially unchanged over the month but is 1.9 million higher than in February\n2020. (See table A-11.)\n\nIn June, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more)\nincreased by 233,000 to 4.0 million, following a decline of 431,000 in May. This\nmeasure is 2.9 million higher than in February 2020. These long-term unemployed\naccounted for 42.1 percent of the total unemployed in June. The number of persons\njobless less than 5 weeks, at 2.0 million, changed little in June. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate was unchanged at 61.6 percent in June and has\nremained within a narrow range of 61.4 percent to 61.7 percent since June 2020.\nThe participation rate is 1.7 percentage points lower than in February 2020. The\nemployment-population ratio, at 58.0 percent, was also unchanged in June but is\nup by 0.6 percentage point since December 2020. However, this measure is 3.1\npercentage points below its February 2020 level. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons decreased by 644,000\nto 4.6 million in June. This decline reflected a drop in the number of persons\nwhose hours were cut due to slack work or business conditions. The number of persons\nemployed part time for economic reasons is up by 229,000 since February 2020. These\nindividuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time\nbecause their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs.\n(See table A-8.)\n\nIn June, the number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was\n6.4 million, little changed over the month but up by 1.4 million since February\n2020. These individuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not\nactively looking for work during the last 4 weeks or were unavailable to take a\njob. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who currently want a job, the number of persons\nmarginally attached to the labor force, at 1.8 million, changed little in June\nbut is up by 393,000 since February 2020. These individuals wanted and were\navailable for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but\nhad not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of\ndiscouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs\nwere available for them, was 617,000 in June, essentially unchanged from the\nprevious month but 216,000 higher than in February 2020. (See Summary table A.)\n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data\n\nIn June, 14.4 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus\npandemic, down from 16.6 percent in the prior month. These data refer to employed\npersons who teleworked or worked at home for pay at some point in the last 4 weeks\nspecifically because of the pandemic.\n\nIn June, 6.2 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because\ntheir employer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not\nwork at all or worked fewer hours at some point in the last 4 weeks due to the\npandemic. This measure is down from 7.9 million in May. Among those who reported\nin June that they were unable to work because of pandemic-related closures or\nlost business, 10.0 percent received at least some pay from their employer for \nthe hours not worked, little changed from the previous month. \n\nAmong those not in the labor force in June, 1.6 million persons were prevented\nfrom looking for work due to the pandemic. This measure is down from 2.5 million\nin May. (To be counted as unemployed, by definition, individuals must be either\nactively looking for work or on temporary layoff.)\n\nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey beginning\nin May 2020 to help gauge the effects of the pandemic on the labor market. The data\nare not seasonally adjusted. Tables with estimates from the supplemental questions\nfor all months are available online at \nwww.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 850,000 in June, following increases of\n583,000 in May and 269,000 in April. In June, nonfarm payroll employment is up by\n15.6 million since April 2020 but is down by 6.8 million, or 4.4 percent, from its\npre-pandemic level in February 2020. Notable job gains in June occurred in leisure\nand hospitality, public and private education, professional and business services,\nretail trade, and other services. (See table B-1. See the box note at the end of \nthis news release for more information about how the establishment survey and its\nmeasures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic.)\n\nIn June, employment in leisure and hospitality increased by 343,000, as pandemic-\nrelated restrictions continued to ease in some parts of the country. Over half of\nthe job gain was in food services and drinking places (+194,000). Employment also\ncontinued to increase in accommodation (+75,000) and in arts, entertainment, and\nrecreation (+74,000). Employment in leisure and hospitality is down by 2.2 million,\nor 12.9 percent, from its level in February 2020.\n\nIn June, employment rose by 155,000 in local government education, by 75,000 in\nstate government education, and by 39,000 in private education. In both public and\nprivate education, staffing fluctuations due to the pandemic, in part reflecting \nthe return to in-person learning and other school-related activities, have distorted\nthe normal seasonal buildup and layoff patterns, likely contributing to the job \ngains in June. (Without the typical seasonal employment increases earlier, there\nwere fewer layoffs at the end of the school year, resulting in job gains after\nseasonal adjustment.) These variations make it more challenging to discern the \ncurrent employment trends in these industries. Since February 2020, employment is\ndown by 414,000 in local government education, by 168,000 in state government\neducation, and by 255,000 in private education.\n\nEmployment in professional and business services rose by 72,000 in June but is down\nby 633,000 since February 2020. In June, employment rose in temporary help services\n(+33,000), advertising and related services (+8,000), scientific research and\ndevelopment services (+7,000), and legal services (+6,000). \n\nRetail trade added 67,000 jobs in June, but employment is down by 303,000, or 1.9\npercent, since February 2020. Over the month, job growth in clothing and clothing\naccessories stores (+28,000), general merchandise stores (+25,000), miscellaneous\nstore retailers (+13,000), and automobile dealers (+8,000) was partially offset by\nlosses in food and beverage stores (-13,000) and health and personal care stores \n(-7,000).\n\nThe other services industry added 56,000 jobs in June, with gains in personal and\nlaundry services (+29,000), in membership associations and organizations (+18,000),\nand in repair and maintenance (+9,000). Employment in other services is 297,000 \nlower than in February 2020. \n\nEmployment in social assistance rose by 32,000 in June, largely in child day care\nservices (+25,000). Employment in social assistance is down by 236,000 from its\nlevel in February 2020.\n\nIn June, wholesale trade added 21,000 jobs, with gains in both the durable and\nnondurable goods components (+14,000 and +9,000, respectively). Employment in\nwholesale trade is 192,000 lower than in February 2020.\n\nEmployment in mining rose by 10,000 in June, reflecting a gain in support \nactivities for mining. Mining employment is down by 110,000 since a peak in January\n2019.\n\nEmployment in manufacturing changed little in June (+15,000). Within the industry,\njob gains in furniture and related products (+9,000), fabricated metal products\n(+6,000), and primary metals (+3,000) were partially offset by a loss in motor\nvehicles and parts (-12,000). Employment in manufacturing is down by 481,000 from\nits level in February 2020.\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing was little changed in June (+11,000).\nEmployment gains in warehousing and storage (+14,000), air transportation (+8,000),\nand truck transportation (+6,000) were partially offset by a loss in couriers and\nmessengers (-24,000). Since February 2020, employment in transportation and \nwarehousing is down by 94,000.\n\nConstruction employment changed little in June (-7,000). Over-the-month job losses\nin nonresidential specialty trade contractors (-15,000) and heavy and civil \nengineering construction (-11,000) were partially offset by a gain in residential\nspecialty trade contractors (+13,000). Employment in construction is 238,000 lower\nthan in February 2020.\n\nIn June, employment showed little change in other major industries, including \ninformation, financial activities, and health care.\n\nAverage hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 10\ncents to $30.40 in June, following increases in May and April (+13 cents and +20\ncents, respectively). Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and \nnonsupervisory employees rose by 10 cents to $25.68 in June. The data for recent\nmonths suggest that the rising demand for labor associated with the recovery from\nthe pandemic may have put upward pressure on wages. However, because average hourly\nearnings vary widely across industries, the large employment fluctuations since\nFebruary 2020 complicate the analysis of recent trends in average hourly earnings.\n(See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nIn June, the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased\nby 0.1 hour to 34.7 hours. In manufacturing, the average workweek fell by 0.2 hour\nto 40.2 hours, and overtime declined by 0.1 hour to 3.2 hours. The average workweek\nfor production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls declined by\n0.2 hour to 34.1 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for April was revised down by 9,000,\nfrom +278,000 to +269,000, and the change for May was revised up by 24,000, from\n+559,000 to +583,000. With these revisions, employment in April and May combined\nis 15,000 higher than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional\nreports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published\nestimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for July is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, August 6, 2021, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    |\n|                   Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on June 2021 Household                    |\n|                              and Establishment Survey Data\t\t\t\t    |\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    |\n| Data collection for both surveys was affected by the pandemic.

The household survey\nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The\nestablishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. For\nmore information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two surveys,\nsee the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn May, the unemployment rate declined by 0.3 percentage point to 5.8 percent, and the \nnumber of unemployed persons fell by 496,000 to 9.3 million. These measures are down\nconsiderably from their recent highs in April 2020 but remain well above their levels \nprior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (3.5 percent and 5.7 million, respectively, \nin February 2020). (See table A-1. See the box note at the end of this news release for \nmore information about how the household survey and its measures were affected by the \ncoronavirus pandemic.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates declined in May for teenagers (9.6\npercent), Whites (5.1 percent), and Hispanics (7.3 percent). The jobless rates for adult \nmen (5.9 percent), adult women (5.4 percent), Blacks (9.1 percent), and Asians (5.5\npercent) showed little change in May. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of persons on temporary layoff declined by 291,000 to 1.8\nmillion in May. This measure is down considerably from the recent high of 18.0 million in\nApril 2020 but is 1.1 million higher than in February 2020. The number of permanent job \nlosers decreased by 295,000 to 3.2 million in May but is 1.9 million higher than in \nFebruary 2020. (See table A-11.)\n\nIn May, the number of persons jobless less than 5 weeks declined by 391,000 to 2.0 \nmillion. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) declined\nby 431,000 to 3.8 million in May but is 2.6 million higher than in February 2020. These \nlong-term unemployed accounted for 40.9 percent of the total unemployed in May. \n(See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate was little changed at 61.6 percent in May and has \nremained within a narrow range of 61.4 percent to 61.7 percent since June 2020. The \nparticipation rate is 1.7 percentage points lower than in February 2020. The employment-\npopulation ratio, at 58.0 percent, was also little changed in May but is up by 0.6 \npercentage point since December 2020. However, this measure is 3.1 percentage points below\nits February 2020 level. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons was essentially unchanged at\n5.3 million in May but is 873,000 higher than in February 2020. These individuals, who \nwould have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had \nbeen reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn May, the number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was \nessentially unchanged over the month at 6.6 million but is up by 1.6 million since\nFebruary 2020. These individuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not\nactively looking for work during the last 4 weeks or were unavailable to take a job. \n(See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who currently want a job, the number of persons \nmarginally attached to the labor force, at 2.0 million, changed little in May but is up\nby 518,000 since February 2020. These individuals wanted and were available for work and \nhad looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not looked for work in the 4\nweeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally\nattached who believed that no jobs were available for them, was 600,000 in May, little \nchanged from the previous month but 199,000 higher than in February 2020. (See Summary\ntable A.)\n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data\n\nIn May, 16.6 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus pandemic, \ndown from 18.3 percent in the prior month. These data refer to employed persons who \nteleworked or worked at home for pay at some point in the last 4 weeks specifically \nbecause of the pandemic.\n\nIn May, 7.9 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because their \nemployer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not work at all or\nworked fewer hours at some point in the last 4 weeks due to the pandemic. This measure is \ndown from 9.4 million in the previous month. Among those who reported in May that they \nwere unable to work because of pandemic-related closures or lost business, 9.3 percent \nreceived at least some pay from their employer for the hours not worked, unchanged from \nthe previous month.\n\nAmong those not in the labor force in May, 2.5 million persons were prevented from looking\nfor work due to the pandemic. This measure is down from 2.8 million the month before. (To\nbe counted as unemployed, by definition, individuals must be either actively looking for \nwork or on temporary layoff.)\n\nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey beginning in May\n2020 to help gauge the effects of the pandemic on the labor market. The data are not \nseasonally adjusted. Tables with estimates from the supplemental questions for all months\nare available online at www.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 559,000 in May, following increases of \n278,000 in April and 785,000 in March. In May, nonfarm payroll employment is down by 7.6\nmillion, or 5.0 percent, from its pre-pandemic level in February 2020. Notable job gains\noccurred in leisure and hospitality, in public and private education, and in health care \nand social assistance in May. (See table B-1. See the box note at the end of this news \nrelease for more information about how the establishment survey and its measures were \naffected by the coronavirus pandemic.)\n\nIn May, employment in leisure and hospitality increased by 292,000, as pandemic-related \nrestrictions continued to ease in some parts of the country. Nearly two-thirds of the \nincrease was in food services and drinking places (+186,000). Employment also rose in \namusements, gambling, and recreation (+58,000) and in accommodation (+35,000). Employment\nin leisure and hospitality is down by 2.5 million, or 15.0 percent, from its level in \nFebruary 2020.\n\nIn May, employment increased in public and private education, reflecting the continued\nresumption of in-person learning and other school-related activities in some parts of \nthe country. Employment rose by 53,000 in local government education, by 50,000 in state\ngovernment education, and by 41,000 in private education. However, employment is down \nfrom February 2020 levels in local government education (-556,000), state government \neducation (-244,000), and private education (-293,000).\n\nHealth care and social assistance added 46,000 jobs in May. Employment in health care \ncontinued to trend up (+23,000), reflecting a gain in ambulatory health care services \n(+22,000). Social assistance added 23,000 jobs over the month, largely in child day care\nservices (+18,000). Compared with February 2020, employment is down by 508,000 in health\ncare and by 257,000 in social assistance. \n\nEmployment in information rose by 29,000 over the month but is down by 193,000 since \nFebruary 2020. In May, job gains occurred in motion picture and sound recording \nindustries (+14,000). \n\nManufacturing employment rose by 23,000 in May. A job gain in motor vehicles and parts\n(+25,000) followed a loss in April (-38,000). Employment in manufacturing is down by \n509,000 from its level in February 2020.\n\nTransportation and warehousing added 23,000 jobs in May. Employment increased in \nsupport activities for transportation (+10,000) and in air transportation (+9,000). \nSince February 2020, employment in transportation and warehousing is down by 100,000. \n\nEmployment in wholesale trade increased by 20,000 in May, mostly in the durable goods\ncomponent (+14,000). Employment in wholesale trade is down by 211,000 since February \n2020.\n\nConstruction employment edged down in May (-20,000), reflecting a job loss in \nnonresidential specialty trade contractors (-17,000). Employment in construction is \n225,000 lower than in February 2020.\n\nEmployment in professional and business services changed little in May (+35,000). Within\nthe industry, employment continued to trend up in accounting and bookkeeping services \n(+14,000). Employment in temporary help services changed little over the month (+4,000),\nfollowing a large decline in April (-116,000). Overall, employment in professional and\nbusiness services is down by 708,000 since February 2020.\n\nEmployment in retail trade changed little in May (-6,000). Clothing and clothing \naccessories stores added 11,000 jobs. Employment in food and beverage stores decreased\nby 26,000, following a decline of 47,000 in April. Employment in retail trade is 411,000\nbelow its February 2020 level.\n\nIn May, employment changed little in other major industries, including mining, financial\nactivities, and other services. \n\nAverage hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 15 \ncents to $30.33 in May, following an increase of 21 cents in April. Average hourly \nearnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees rose by 14 cents to\n$25.60 in May, following an increase of 19 cents in April. The data for the last 2 \nmonths suggest that the rising demand for labor associated with the recovery from the \npandemic may have put upward pressure on wages. However, because average hourly \nearnings vary widely across industries, the large employment fluctuations since \nFebruary 2020 complicate the analysis of recent trends in average hourly earnings. \n(See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nIn May, the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was 34.9 \nhours for the third month in a row. In manufacturing, the average workweek rose by 0.1\nhour to 40.5 hours, and overtime increased by 0.1 hour to 3.3 hours. The average \nworkweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls \ndeclined by 0.1 hour to 34.3 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for March was revised up by 15,000, from\n+770,000 to +785,000, and the change for April was revised up by 12,000, from +266,000 to\n+278,000. With these revisions, employment in March and April combined is 27,000 higher \nthan previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from\nbusinesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the \nrecalculation of seasonal factors.) \n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for June is scheduled to be released on Friday, July 2, 2021,\nat 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|                Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on May 2021 Household and                |\n|\t\t\t\tEstablishment Survey Data               \t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Data collection for both surveys was affected by the pandemic.

These measures are down considerably from their\nrecent highs in April 2020 but remain well above their levels prior to the coronavirus \n(COVID-19) pandemic (3.5 percent and 5.7 million, respectively, in February 2020). (See\ntable A-1.

This measure is down considerably from the recent high of 18.0 million\nin April 2020 but is 1.4 million higher than in February 2020. The number of permanent \njob losers, at 3.5 million, was also little changed over the month but is 2.2 million \nhigher than in February 2020.

However, this measure is 3.2 percentage points below its February 2020\nlevel. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons decreased by 583,000 to\n5.2 million in April. This decline reflected a drop in the number of people whose \nhours were cut due to slack work or business conditions. The number of persons employed\npart time for economic reasons is 845,000 higher than in February 2020. These \nindividuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time \nbecause their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs.

In April, nonfarm employment is down by 8.2 \nmillion, or 5.4 percent, from its pre-pandemic level in February 2020. In April, notable\njob gains in leisure and hospitality, other services, and local government education were\npartially offset by losses in temporary help services and in couriers and messengers. \n(See table B-1. See the box note at the end of this news release for more information about\nhow the establishment survey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic.)\n\nIn April, employment in leisure and hospitality increased by 331,000, as pandemic-related\nrestrictions continued to ease in many parts of the country. More than half of the increase\nwas in food services and drinking places (+187,000). Job gains also occurred in amusements,\ngambling, and recreation (+73,000) and in accommodation (+54,000). Although leisure and \nhospitality has added 5.4 million jobs over the year, employment in the industry is down\nby 2.8 million, or 16.8 percent, since February 2020.\n\nIn April, employment increased by 44,000 in the other services industry, with gains in \nrepair and maintenance (+14,000) and personal and laundry services (+14,000). Employment\nin other services is 352,000 below its February 2020 level.\n\nEmployment in local government education increased by 31,000 in April but is 611,000 lower\nthan in February 2020. Federal government employment increased by 9,000 over the month. \n\nIn April, employment in social assistance rose by 23,000, with about half of the increase\nin child day care services (+12,000). Employment in social assistance is 286,000 lower \nthan in February 2020. \n\nEmployment in financial activities rose by 19,000 over the month, with most of the gain \noccurring in real estate and rental and leasing (+17,000). Employment in financial \nactivities is down by 63,000 since February 2020. \n\nWithin professional and business services, employment in temporary help services declined\nby 111,000 in April and is 296,000 lower than in February 2020. Business support services\nlost jobs in April (-15,000), while architectural and engineering services and scientific\nresearch and development services added jobs (+12,000 and +7,000, respectively). \n\nWithin transportation and warehousing, employment in couriers and messengers fell by \n77,000 in April but is up by 126,000 since February 2020. Air transportation added 7,000\njobs over the month. \n\nManufacturing employment edged down in April (-18,000), following gains in the previous 2\nmonths (+54,000 in March and +35,000 in February). In April, job losses in motor vehicles\nand parts (-27,000) and in wood products (-7,000) more than offset job gains in \nmiscellaneous durable goods manufacturing (+13,000) and chemicals (+4,000). Employment in\nmanufacturing is 515,000 lower than in February 2020.\n\nRetail trade employment changed little in April (-15,000), following a gain in the prior \nmonth (+33,000). In April, employment declined in food and beverage stores (-49,000), \ngeneral merchandise stores (-10,000), and gasoline stations (-9,000). These losses were \npartially offset by employment increases in sporting goods, hobby, book, and music stores\n(+20,000); clothing and clothing accessories stores (+10,000); and health and personal \ncare stores (+9,000). Employment in retail trade overall is 400,000 lower than in February\n2020.\n\nEmployment in health care changed little in April (-4,000), as a job gain in ambulatory \nhealth care services (+21,000) was largely offset by a job loss in nursing care facilities\n(-19,000). Health care employment is down by 542,000 since February 2020.\n\nEmployment in construction was unchanged over the month. Employment in the industry is up\nby 917,000 over the year but is 196,000 below its February 2020 level.\n\nIn April, employment changed little in other major industries, including mining, \nwholesale trade, and information.\n\nIn April, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls \nincreased by 21 cents to $30.17, following a decline of 4 cents in the prior month. In\nApril, average hourly earnings for private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees\nrose by 20 cents to $25.45. The data for April suggest that the rising demand for labor \nassociated with the recovery from the pandemic may have put upward pressure on wages. \nSince average hourly earnings vary widely across industries, the large employment \nfluctuations since February 2020 complicate the analysis of recent trends in average \nhourly earnings. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.1 hour \nto 35.0 hours in April. In manufacturing, the workweek and overtime were both unchanged \nover the month, at 40.5 hours and 3.2 hours, respectively. The average workweek for \nproduction and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.4 \nhours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for February was revised up by 68,000, from\n+468,000 to +536,000, and the change for March was revised down by 146,000, from +916,000\nto +770,000. With these revisions, employment in February and March combined is 78,000 \nlower than previously reported.

These \nimprovements in the labor market reflect the continued resumption of economic activity \nthat had been curtailed due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Job growth was \nwidespread in March, led by gains in leisure and hospitality, public and private \neducation, and construction. \n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey \nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. \nThe establishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry.\nFor more information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two\nsurveys, see the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate edged down to 6.0 percent in March. The rate is down considerably\nfrom its recent high in April 2020 but is 2.5 percentage points higher than its pre-\npandemic level in February 2020. The number of unemployed persons, at 9.7 million, \ncontinued to trend down in March but is 4.0 million higher than in February 2020. (See\ntable A-1. See the box note at the end of this news release for more information about \nhow the household survey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for Asians rose to 6.0 percent in\nMarch, following a decline in the previous month. The jobless rate for Hispanics edged\ndown to 7.9 percent over the month, while the rates for adult men (5.8 percent), adult\nwomen (5.7 percent), teenagers (13.0 percent), Whites (5.4 percent), and Blacks (9.6 \npercent) changed little. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of persons on temporary layoff declined by 203,000 in\nMarch to 2.0 million. This measure is down considerably from the recent high of 18.0 \nmillion in April 2020 but is 1.3 million higher than in February 2020. The number of \npermanent job losers, at 3.4 million, was little changed in March but is 2.1 million \nhigher than February 2020. (See table A-11.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more), at 4.2 million,\nchanged little over the month but is up by 3.1 million since February 2020. In March, \nthese long-term unemployed accounted for 43.4 percent of the total unemployed. The \nnumber of persons jobless 5 to 14 weeks declined by 313,000 to 1.9 million. The number \nof persons jobless less than 5 weeks, at 2.2 million, was essentially unchanged over \nthe month. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate changed little at 61.5 percent in March. This \nmeasure is 1.8 percentage points lower than in February 2020. The employment-population\nratio, at 57.8 percent, was up by 0.2 percentage point over the month but is 3.3 \npercentage points lower than in February 2020.  (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 5.8 million, changed \nlittle in March but is 1.4 million higher than in February 2020. These individuals, who\nwould have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours \nhad been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was about \nunchanged at 6.9 million in March but is up by 1.8 million since February 2020. These \nindividuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for \nwork during the last 4 weeks or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who currently want a job, the number of persons \nmarginally attached to the labor force, at 1.9 million, was essentially unchanged in \nMarch but is up by 416,000 since February 2020. These individuals wanted and were \navailable for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not\nlooked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a\nsubset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them, was\n523,000 in March, essentially unchanged from the previous month. (See Summary table A.)\n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data\n\nIn March, 21.0 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus pandemic,\ndown from 22.7 percent in the prior month. These data refer to employed persons who \nteleworked or worked at home for pay at some point in the last 4 weeks specifically \nbecause of the pandemic.\n\nIn March, 11.4 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because their\nemployer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not work at all\nor worked fewer hours at some point in the last 4 weeks due to the pandemic. This measure\nis down from 13.3 million in the previous month. Among those who reported in March that \nthey were unable to work because of pandemic-related closures or lost business, 10.2 \npercent received at least some pay from their employer for the hours not worked, little \nchanged from the previous month.\n\nAmong those not in the labor force in March, 3.7 million persons were prevented from \nlooking for work due to the pandemic. This measure is down from 4.2 million the month \nbefore. (To be counted as unemployed, by definition, individuals must be either actively \nlooking for work or on temporary layoff.)\n\nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey beginning in May\n2020 to help gauge the effects of the pandemic on the labor market. The data are not \nseasonally adjusted. Tables with estimates from the supplemental questions for all months\nare available online at www.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 916,000 in March but is down by 8.4 million,\nor 5.5 percent, from its pre-pandemic peak in February 2020. Job growth in March was \nwidespread, with the largest gains occurring in leisure and hospitality, public and \nprivate education, and construction. (See table B-1. See the box note at the end of this \nnews release for more information about how the establishment survey and its measures were\naffected by the coronavirus pandemic.)\n\nIn March, employment in leisure and hospitality increased by 280,000, as pandemic-related\nrestrictions eased in many parts of the country. Nearly two-thirds of the increase was in\nfood services and drinking places (+176,000). Job gains also occurred in arts, \nentertainment, and recreation (+64,000) and in accommodation (+40,000). Employment in \nleisure and hospitality is down by 3.1 million, or 18.5 percent, since February 2020.\n\nIn March, employment increased in both public and private education, reflecting the \ncontinued resumption of in-person learning and other school-related activities in many \nparts of the country. Employment rose by 76,000 in local government education, by 50,000 \nin state government education, and by 64,000 in private education. Employment is down \nfrom February 2020 in local government education (-594,000), state government education \n(-270,000), and private education (-310,000).\n\nConstruction added 110,000 jobs in March, following job losses in the previous month \n(-56,000) that were likely weather-related. Employment growth in the industry was \nwidespread in March, with gains of 65,000 in specialty trade contractors, 27,000 in heavy\nand civil engineering construction, and 18,000 in construction of buildings. Employment \nin construction is 182,000 below its February 2020 level.\n\nEmployment in professional and business services rose by 66,000 over the month but is \ndown by 685,000 since February 2020. In March, employment in administrative and support\nservices continued to trend up (+37,000), although employment in its temporary help \nservices component was essentially unchanged. Employment also continued on an upward \ntrend in management and technical consulting services (+8,000) and in computer systems \ndesign and related services (+6,000). \n\nManufacturing employment rose by 53,000 in March, with job gains occurring in both \ndurable goods (+30,000) and nondurable goods (+23,000). Employment in manufacturing is \ndown by 515,000 since February 2020.\n\nTransportation and warehousing added 48,000 jobs in March. Employment increased in \ncouriers and messengers (+17,000), transit and ground passenger transportation (+13,000),\nsupport activities for transportation (+6,000), and air transportation (+6,000). Since \nFebruary 2020, employment in couriers and messengers is up by 206,000 (or 23.3 percent),\nwhile employment is down by 112,000 (or 22.8 percent) in transit and ground passenger \ntransportation and by 104,000 (or 20.1 percent) in air transportation. \n\nEmployment in the other services industry increased by 42,000 over the month, reflecting\njob gains in personal and laundry services (+19,000) and in repair and maintenance \n(+18,000). Employment in other services is down by 396,000 since February 2020.\n\nSocial assistance added 25,000 jobs in March, mostly in individual and family services \n(+20,000). Employment in social assistance is 306,000 lower than in February 2020.\n\nEmployment in wholesale trade increased by 24,000 in March, with job gains in both \ndurable goods (+14,000) and nondurable goods (+10,000). Employment in wholesale trade is\n234,000 lower than in February 2020.\n\nRetail trade added 23,000 jobs in March. Job growth in clothing and clothing accessories\nstores (+16,000), motor vehicle and parts dealers (+13,000), and furniture and home \nfurnishing stores (+6,000) was partially offset by losses in building material and garden\nsupply stores (-9,000) and general merchandise stores (-7,000). Employment in retail \ntrade is 381,000 below its February 2020 level.\n\nEmployment in mining rose by 21,000 in March, largely in support activities for mining \n(+19,000). Mining employment is down by 130,000 since a peak in January 2019.\n\nFinancial activities added 16,000 jobs in March. Job gains in insurance carriers and \nrelated activities (+11,000) and real estate (+10,000) more than offset losses in credit\nintermediation and related activities (-7,000). Financial activities has 87,000 fewer \njobs than in February 2020.\n \nEmployment in health care and information changed little in March. \n\nIn March, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls fell by\n4 cents to $29.96. Average hourly earnings for private-sector production and \nnonsupervisory employees, at $25.21, changed little (+2 cents). The large employment \nfluctuations over the past year--especially in industries with lower-paid workers--\ncomplicate the analysis of recent trends in average hourly earnings. (See tables B-3 \nand B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.3 hour\nto 34.9 hours in March, following a decline of 0.4 hour in the prior month. In \nmanufacturing, the workweek increased by 0.2 hour to 40.5 hours over the month, and \novertime increased by 0.1 hour to 3.3 hours. The average workweek for production and \nnonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 0.3 hour to 34.3 hours. \n(See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for January was revised up by 67,000, from\n+166,000 to +233,000, and the change for February was revised up by 89,000, from +379,000\nto +468,000. With these revisions, employment in January and February combined was 156,000\nhigher than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports \nreceived from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and \nfrom the recalculation of seasonal factors.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for April is scheduled to be released on Friday, May 7, 2021,\nat 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|                      Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on March 2021                      |\n|\t\t\t Household and Establishment Survey Data\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Data collection for both surveys was affected by the pandemic.

For\nmore information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two \nsurveys, see the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nBoth the unemployment rate, at 6.2 percent, and the number of unemployed persons, at \n10.0 million, changed little in February. Although both measures are much lower than \ntheir April 2020 highs, they remain well above their pre-pandemic levels in February 2020\n(3.5 percent and 5.7 million, respectively). (See table A-1. See the box note at the end\nof this news release for more information about how the household survey and its measures\nwere affected by the coronavirus pandemic.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for Asians declined to 5.1 percent\nin February. The rates for adult men (6.0 percent), adult women (5.9 percent), teenagers\n(13.9 percent), Whites (5.6 percent), Blacks (9.9 percent), and Hispanics (8.5 percent)\nshowed little or no change. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of persons on temporary layoff fell by 517,000 in \nFebruary to 2.2 million. This measure is 1.5 million higher than the level a year \nearlier but is down considerably from the recent high of 18.0 million in April 2020. The\nnumber of permanent job losers, at 3.5 million, was essentially unchanged in February \nbut is 2.2 million higher than a year earlier. (See table A-11.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more), at 4.1 million,\nchanged little over the month but is up by 3.0 million over the year. In February, these\nlong-term unemployed accounted for 41.5 percent of the total unemployed. The number of \npersons jobless less than 5 weeks, at 2.2 million, also changed little over the month. \n(See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate remained at 61.4 percent in February. This measure is\n1.9 percentage points lower than the value a year earlier. The employment-population \nratio, at 57.6 percent, changed little over the month but is down by 3.5 percentage \npoints over the year.

In February of \nthis year, most of the job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, with smaller gains\nin temporary help services, health care and social assistance, retail trade, and \nmanufacturing. Employment declined in state and local government education, construction,\nand mining. (See table B-1. See the box note at the end of this news release for more \ninformation about how the establishment survey and its measures were affected by the \ncoronavirus pandemic.)\n\nIn February, employment in leisure and hospitality increased by 355,000, as pandemic-\nrelated restrictions eased in some parts of the country. About four-fifths of the \nincrease was in food services and drinking places (+286,000). Employment also rose in \naccommodation (+36,000) and in amusements, gambling, and recreation (+33,000). \nEmployment in leisure and hospitality is down over the year by 3.5 million, or 20.4\npercent.\n\nWithin professional and business services, temporary help services added 53,000 jobs in\nFebruary but is down by 175,000 from a year ago. \n\nEmployment in health care and social assistance increased by 46,000 in February. Health\ncare employment was little changed over the month (+20,000), following a large decline\nin the prior month (-85,000). In February, job gains in ambulatory health care services\n(+29,000) were partially offset by losses in nursing care facilities (-12,000). \nEmployment in social assistance rose by 26,000, mostly in individual and family \nservices (+18,000). Employment in health care and social assistance is down by 909,000\nover the year.\n\nRetail trade added 41,000 jobs in February. Job growth was widespread in the industry, \nwith the largest gains occurring in general merchandise stores (+14,000), health and \npersonal care stores (+12,000), and food and beverage stores (+10,000). These gains were\npartially offset by a loss in clothing and clothing accessories stores (-20,000). \nFollowing steep job losses in March and April of 2020 (-2.4 million jobs over the 2 \nmonths combined), retail trade has added 2.0 million jobs from May through February. \n\nManufacturing employment increased by 21,000 over the month, led by a gain in \ntransportation equipment (+10,000). Employment in manufacturing is down by 561,000 over \nthe year.\n\nIn February, employment declined in local government education (-37,000) and state \ngovernment education (-32,000). For both industries, February losses partially offset\ngains in January. Pandemic-related employment declines in 2020 distorted the normal \nseasonal buildup and layoff patterns in the education sector, making it more challenging\nto discern the current employment trends in these industries.\n\nEmployment in construction fell by 61,000 in February, largely reflecting declines in \nnonresidential specialty trade contractors (-37,000) and heavy and civil engineering \nconstruction (-21,000). Severe winter weather across much of the country may have held \ndown employment in construction. Employment in the industry is 308,000 below its level a\nyear earlier.\n\nMining shed 8,000 jobs in February, with losses occurring in support activities for\nmining (-6,000) and in oil and gas extraction (-2,000). Mining has lost 153,000 jobs \nsince an employment peak in January 2019, though nearly two-thirds of the loss has \noccurred over the past year.\n\nIn February, employment changed little in other major industries, including wholesale \ntrade, transportation and warehousing, information, financial activities, and other \nservices. \n\nIn February, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls \nincreased by 7 cents to $30.01. Average hourly earnings for private-sector production \nand nonsupervisory employees, at $25.19, changed little (+4 cents). The large employment\nfluctuations over the past year--especially in industries with lower-paid workers--\ncomplicate the analysis of recent trends in average hourly earnings. (See tables B-3 and\nB-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls declined by 0.3 hour \nto 34.6 hours in February. In manufacturing, the workweek declined by 0.2 hour to 40.2 \nhours, and overtime declined by 0.1 hour to 3.1 hours. The average workweek for \nproduction and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls declined by 0.4 hour \nto 34.0 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for December was revised down by 79,000, \nfrom -227,000 to -306,000, and the change for January was revised up by 117,000, from \n+49,000 to +166,000. With these revisions, employment in December and January combined \nwas 38,000 higher than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional \nreports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published \nestimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.)\n\n____________\nThe Employment Situation for March is scheduled to be released on Friday, April 2, 2021,\nat 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|                    Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on February 2021                     |\n|\t\t\tHousehold and Establishment Survey Data\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Data collection for both surveys was affected by the pandemic.

The labor market continued to reflect the impact of the coronavirus \n(COVID-19) pandemic and efforts to contain it.

Also, household survey data  |\n| for January 2021 reflect updated population estimates. See the notes at the end of \t|\n| this news release for more information about these changes.\t\t\t\t|\n|_______________________________________________________________________________________|\n\n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey \nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The\nestablishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. For\nmore information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two \nsurveys, see the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn January, the unemployment rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 6.3 percent, and the \nnumber of unemployed persons decreased to 10.1 million. Although both measures are much\nlower than their April 2020 highs, they remain well above their pre-pandemic levels in \nFebruary 2020 (3.5 percent and 5.7 million, respectively). (See table A-1. See the note\nat the end of the news release and tables B and C for information about annual \npopulation adjustments to the household survey estimates. See the box note at the end \nof this news release for more information about how the household survey and its \nmeasures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates declined over the month for adult\nmen (6.0 percent), adult women (6.0 percent), Whites (5.7 percent), and Hispanics (8.6\npercent). The jobless rates changed little for teenagers (14.8 percent), Blacks (9.2 \npercent), and Asians (6.6 percent). (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of persons on temporary layoff decreased in January \nto 2.7 million. This measure is down considerably from the recent high of 18.0 million\nin April but is 2.0 million higher than its February level. The number of permanent \njob losers, at 3.5 million, changed little in January but is 2.2 million higher than \nin February. The number of reentrants to the labor force decreased in January to 2.0 \nmillion. (Reentrants are persons who previously worked but were not in the labor force\nprior to beginning their job search.) (See table A-11.)\n\nIn January, the number of persons jobless less than 5 weeks decreased to 2.3 million.\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more), at 4.0 \nmillion, was about unchanged in January and accounted for 39.5 percent of the total \nunemployed. (See table A-12.)\n\nAfter accounting for the annual adjustments to the population controls, both the \ncivilian labor force and the number of employed persons changed little in January. At\n61.4 percent, the labor force participation rate was about unchanged over the month \nbut is 1.9 percentage points lower than its February level. The employment-population\nratio, at 57.5 percent in January, changed little over the month but is 3.6 percentage\npoints lower than in February. (See table A-1. For additional information about the\neffects of the population adjustments, see table C.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 6.0 million, \nchanged little in January. This measure is 1.6 million higher than the February level.\nThese individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part\ntime because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs.\n(See table A-8.)\n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job, at 7.0 million,\nedged down in January but is 1.9 million higher than in February. These individuals \nwere not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work during\nthe last 4 weeks or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons marginally attached to the labor force, at 1.9 million,\ndecreased in January. These individuals wanted and were available for work and had \nlooked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not looked for work in the 4\nweeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a subset of the \nmarginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them, was little \nchanged over the month at 624,000. (See Summary table A.)\n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data\n\nIn January, the share of employed persons who teleworked because of the coronavirus \npandemic edged down to 23.2 percent. These data refer to employed persons who \nteleworked or worked at home for pay at some point in the last 4 weeks specifically \nbecause of the pandemic.\n\nIn January, 14.8 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because \ntheir employer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not \nwork at all or worked fewer hours at some point in the last 4 weeks due to the \npandemic. This measure is 1.1 million lower than in December. Among those who \nreported in January that they were unable to work because of pandemic-related \nclosures or lost business, 12.7 percent received at least some pay from their \nemployer for the hours not worked, little changed from the previous month.\n\nAmong those not in the labor force in January, 4.7 million persons were prevented \nfrom looking for work due to the pandemic; this measure is little changed from \nDecember. (To be counted as unemployed, by definition, individuals must be either \nactively looking for work or on temporary layoff.)\n\nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey beginning \nin May 2020 to help gauge the effects of the pandemic on the labor market. The data \nare not seasonally adjusted. Tables with estimates from the supplemental questions \nfor all months are available online at \nwww.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment changed little in January (+49,000) but is below its\nFebruary 2020 level by 9.9 million, or 6.5 percent. In January, notable job gains in \nprofessional and business services and in both public and private education were \noffset by losses in leisure and hospitality, in retail trade, in health care, and in \ntransportation and warehousing. (See table B-1. See the note at the end of this news \nrelease and table A for information about the annual benchmark process. See the box \nnote at the end of this news release for more information about how the establishment\nsurvey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic.)\n\nIn January, employment in professional and business services rose by 97,000, with \ntemporary help services accounting for most of the gain (+81,000). Job growth also \noccurred in management and technical consulting services (+16,000), computer systems\ndesign and related services (+11,000), and scientific research and development \nservices (+10,000). These gains were partially offset by job losses in services to \nbuildings and dwellings (-14,000) and in advertising and related services (-6,000). \nSince February, employment in professional and business services is down by 825,000.\n\nIn January, employment increased in local government education (+49,000), state \ngovernment education (+36,000), and private education (+34,000). In both public and \nprivate education, pandemic-related employment declines in 2020 distorted the normal\nseasonal buildup and layoff patterns. This likely contributed to the job gains in \nJanuary (after seasonal adjustment). \n\nWholesale trade continued to add jobs in January (+14,000). However, employment in\nthe industry is 263,000 below its February level.\n\nIn January, employment in mining increased by 9,000, with a gain of 8,000 in support\nactivities for mining. Mining employment is down by 133,000 since a recent peak in \nJanuary 2019, though employment in the industry showed little change for several \nmonths prior to the uptick in January. \n\nIn January, employment in leisure and hospitality declined by 61,000, following a \nsteep decline in December (-536,000). In January, employment edged down in \namusements, gambling, and recreation (-27,000) and in accommodation (-18,000). \nEmployment in food services and drinking places continued to trend down (-19,000). \nEmployment in leisure and hospitality fell by 8.2 million during March and April, \nincreased by 4.9 million from May to November, and then declined by 597,000 over \nthe past 2 months. Since February, employment in leisure and hospitality is down \nby 3.9 million, or 22.9 percent. \n\nRetail trade lost 38,000 jobs in January, after adding 135,000 jobs in December. Over \nthe month, employment declined in general merchandise stores (-38,000), electronics \nand appliance stores (-29,000), and nonstore retailers (-15,000). These job losses\nwere partially offset by gains in food and beverage stores (+15,000), clothing and \nclothing accessories stores (+15,000), and health and personal care stores (+14,000).\nEmployment in retail trade is 383,000 lower than in February.\n\nEmployment in health care declined by 30,000 in January. Within the industry, job \nlosses occurred in nursing care facilities (-19,000), home health care services \n(-13,000), and community care facilities for the elderly (-7,000). Since February, \nhealth care employment is down by 542,000.\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing declined by 28,000 in January and is \n164,000 lower than in February. In January, job losses occurred in warehousing and \nstorage (-17,000) and in couriers and messengers (-14,000); however, employment in \nthese industries is higher than in February by 97,000 and 137,000, respectively. \nEmployment in air transportation increased by 15,000 over the month but is 105,000 \nlower than in February.\n\nEmployment in manufacturing changed little over the month (-10,000), following 8 \nmonths of growth. Within the industry, durable goods lost 17,000 jobs in January. \nEmployment in manufacturing is up by 803,000 since April but is 582,000 lower than\nin February.\n\nConstruction employment changed little over the month (-3,000), after increasing \nfor 8 consecutive months. However, employment in the industry is down by 256,000 \nsince February.\n\nIn January, employment changed little in other major industries, including \ninformation, financial activities, and other services. \n\nIn January, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls \nincreased by 6 cents to $29.96. Average hourly earnings of private-sector \nproduction and nonsupervisory employees, at $25.18, changed little (+3 cents). The\nlarge employment fluctuations over the past several months--especially in \nindustries with lower-paid workers--complicate the analysis of recent trends in \naverage hourly earnings. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by \n0.3 hour to 35.0 hours in January. In manufacturing, the workweek also increased \nby 0.3 hour to 40.4 hours, and overtime was unchanged at 3.2 hours. The average \nworkweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls \nincreased by 0.2 hour to 34.4 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for November was revised down by \n72,000, from +336,000 to +264,000, and the change for December was revised down \nby 87,000, from -140,000 to -227,000. With these revisions, employment in November\nand December combined was 159,000 lower than previously reported. (Monthly \nrevisions result from additional reports received from businesses and government\nagencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal\nfactors. The annual benchmark process also contributed to the November and \nDecember revisions.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for February is scheduled to be released on Friday, \nMarch 5, 2021, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t     Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on January 2021     \t\t\t|\n|\t\t\tHousehold and Establishment Survey Data\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Data collection for both surveys was affected by the pandemic.

These \ncounts are derived principally from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW),\nwhich counts jobs covered by the Unemployment Insurance (UI) tax system. The benchmark \nprocess results in revisions to not seasonally adjusted data from April 2019 forward. \nSeasonally adjusted data from January 2016 forward are subject to revision. In addition,\ndata for some series prior to 2016, both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted, incorporate\nother revisions. \n\nThe total nonfarm employment level for March 2020 was revised downward by 250,000 (on a\nnot seasonally adjusted basis, -121,000 or -0.1 percent). Not seasonally adjusted, the \nabsolute average benchmark revision over the past 10 years is 0.2 percent. \n\nThe over-the-year change in total nonfarm employment for March 2020 was revised from \n+808,000 to +577,000 (seasonally adjusted). Table A presents revised total nonfarm \nemployment data on a seasonally adjusted basis from January to December 2020.\n\nAll revised historical establishment survey data are available on the BLS website at \nwww.bls.gov/ces/data/home.htm. In addition, an article that discusses the benchmark \nand post-benchmark revisions and other technical issues is available at \nwww.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesbmart.htm. \n\n\nTable A.

Population estimates for the household survey are developed\nby the U.S. Census Bureau. Each year, the Census Bureau updates the estimates to \nreflect new information and assumptions about the growth of the population since the \nprevious decennial census. The change in population reflected in the new estimates \nresults from adjustments for net international migration, updated vital statistics, \nand estimation methodology improvements. \n\nIn accordance with usual practice, BLS will not revise the official household survey \nestimates for December 2020 and earlier months. To show the impact of the population \nadjustments, however, differences in selected December 2020 labor force series based \non the old and new population estimates are shown in table B.\n\nThe adjustments decreased the estimated size of the civilian noninstitutional \npopulation in December by 476,000, the civilian labor force by 200,000, employment by\n180,000, and unemployment by 20,000. The number of persons not in the labor force was\ndecreased by 277,000. The total unemployment rate, employment-population ratio, and \nlabor force participation rate were unaffected.\n\nData users are cautioned that these annual population adjustments can affect the \ncomparability of household data series over time. Table C shows the effect of the \nintroduction of new population estimates on the comparison of selected labor force \nmeasures between December 2020 and January 2021.

The \ndecline in payroll employment reflects the recent increase in coronavirus (COVID-19) cases \nand efforts to contain the pandemic. In December, job losses in leisure and hospitality and\nin private education were partially offset by gains in professional and business services,\nretail trade, and construction. \n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey \nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The\nestablishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. For \nmore information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two surveys,\nsee the Technical Note.\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t   Revision of Seasonally Adjusted Household Survey Data\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Seasonally adjusted household survey data have been revised using updated seasonal \t|\n| adjustment factors, a procedure done at the end of each calendar year. Seasonally \t|\n| adjusted estimates back to January 2016 were subject to revision. The unemployment\t|\n| rates for January 2020 through November 2020 (as originally published and as revised) |\n| appear in table A at the end of this news release, along with additional information  |\n| about the revisions.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|_______________________________________________________________________________________|\n\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn December, both the unemployment rate, at 6.7 percent, and the number of unemployed \npersons, at 10.7 million, were unchanged. Although both measures are much lower than their\nApril highs, they are nearly twice their pre-pandemic levels in February (3.5 percent and \n5.7 million, respectively). (See table A-1. For more information about how the household\nsurvey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic, see the box note at the\nend of this news release.) \n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for teenagers (16.0 percent) and \nHispanics (9.3 percent) increased in December. The jobless rates for adult men (6.4 \npercent), adult women (6.3 percent), Whites (6.0 percent), Blacks (9.9 percent), and \nAsians (5.9 percent) showed little change. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.) \n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of persons on temporary layoff increased by 277,000 in \nDecember to 3.0 million. This measure is down considerably from the high of 18.0 million \nin April but is 2.3 million higher than in February. The number of permanent job losers \ndeclined by 348,000 to 3.4 million in December but is up by 2.1 million since February. \nThe number of unemployed reentrants increased by 282,000 to 2.3 million over the month, \n452,000 higher than in February. (See table A-11.) \n\nIn December, the number of persons jobless less than 5 weeks increased by 449,000 to 2.9\nmillion, while the number of persons jobless 15 to 26 weeks declined by 303,000 to 1.6 \nmillion. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more), at 4.0\nmillion, was essentially unchanged in December but has increased by 2.8 million since \nFebruary. The number of those jobless for 27 weeks or more accounted for 37.1 percent of\ntotal unemployed in December. (See table A-12.) \n\nThe labor force participation rate and the employment-population ratio were both \nunchanged over the month, at 61.5 percent and 57.4 percent, respectively. These measures \nare up from their recent April lows but are lower than in February by 1.8 percentage\npoints and 3.7 percentage points, respectively. (See table A-1.) \n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 6.2 million, decreased\nby 471,000 over the month. This measure is down from its April high of 10.9 million but\nis 1.8 million higher than the February level. These individuals, who would have \npreferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been \nreduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.) \n\nIn December, the number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job, at \n7.3 million, was little changed over the month but is 2.3 million higher than in \nFebruary. These individuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not \nactively looking for work during the last 4 weeks or were unavailable to take a job. \n(See table A-1.) \n\nAmong those not in the labor force who currently want a job, the number of persons \nmarginally attached to the labor force, at 2.2 million, changed little in December but\nis up by 749,000 since February. These individuals wanted and were available for work\nand had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not looked for work in\nthe 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a subset of the \nmarginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them, was essentially \nunchanged at 663,000 in December but is up by 262,000 since February. (See Summary \ntable A.)  \n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data\n\nIn December, 23.7 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus \npandemic, up from 21.8 percent in November. These data refer to employed persons who \nteleworked or worked at home for pay at some point in the last 4 weeks specifically \nbecause of the pandemic. \n\nIn December, 15.8 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because \ntheir employer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not work\nat all or worked fewer hours at some point in the last 4 weeks due to the pandemic. \nThis measure is 1.0 million higher than in November. Among those who reported in \nDecember that they were unable to work because of pandemic-related closures or lost \nbusiness, 12.8 percent received at least some pay from their employer for the hours \nnot worked, little changed from November.  \n\nAmong those not in the labor force in December, 4.6 million persons were prevented \nfrom looking for work due to the pandemic. This measure is up from 3.9 million in\nNovember. (To be counted as unemployed, by definition, individuals must be either \nactively looking for work or on temporary layoff.)  \n \nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey beginning\nin May to help gauge the effects of the pandemic on the labor market. The data are \nnot seasonally adjusted. Tables with estimates from the supplemental questions for\nall months are available online at \nwww.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm. \n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment declined by 140,000 in December. Employment declines\nin leisure and hospitality, private education, and government were partially offset by\ngains in professional and business services, retail trade, construction, and \ntransportation and warehousing. In December, nonfarm employment was below its February\nlevel by 9.8 million, or 6.5 percent. (See table B-1. For more information about how \nthe establishment survey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic,\nsee the box note at the end of this news release.)\n\nIn December, employment in leisure and hospitality declined by 498,000, with three-\nquarters of the decrease in food services and drinking places (-372,000). Employment\nalso fell in the amusements, gambling, and recreation industry (-92,000) and in the \naccommodation industry (-24,000). Since February, employment in leisure and \nhospitality is down by 3.9 million, or 23.2 percent. \n\nEmployment in private education decreased by 63,000 in December. Employment in the\nindustry is down by 450,000 since February.\n\nGovernment employment declined by 45,000 in December. Employment in the component of \nlocal government that excludes education declined by 32,000, and state government \neducation lost 20,000 jobs. Federal government employment increased by 6,000. Since \nFebruary, government employment overall is down by 1.3 million. \n\nOther services lost 22,000 jobs in December, with over half of the loss in personal\nand laundry services (-12,000). Employment in the other services industry is down by \n453,000 since February.\n\nIn December, employment in professional and business services increased by 161,000,\nwith a large gain in temporary help services (+68,000). Job growth also occurred in \ncomputer systems design and related services (+20,000), other professional and technical\nservices (+11,000), management of companies and enterprises (+11,000), and business \nsupport services (+7,000). Employment in professional and business services is down by\n858,000 since February.\n\nRetail trade added 121,000 jobs in December, with nearly half of the growth occurring\nin the component of general merchandise stores that includes warehouse clubs and \nsupercenters (+59,000). Job gains also occurred in nonstore retailers (+14,000), \nautomobile dealers (+13,000), health and personal care stores (+10,000), and food and\nbeverage stores (+8,000). Employment in retail trade is 411,000 lower than in February.\n\nConstruction added 51,000 jobs in December, but employment in the industry is 226,000 \nbelow its February level. In December, employment rose in residential specialty trade \ncontractors (+14,000) and residential building (+9,000), two industries that have \ngained back the jobs lost in March and April. In December, employment also increased \nin nonresidential specialty trade contractors (+18,000) and in heavy and civil \nengineering construction (+15,000).\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing rose by 47,000 in December, largely in \ncouriers and messengers (+37,000). While employment in transportation and warehousing\noverall is 89,000 lower than in February, employment in couriers and messengers has\nincreased by 222,000 over the same period. In December, employment also grew in \nwarehousing and storage (+8,000) and in truck transportation (+7,000), while transit\nand ground passenger transportation lost 9,000 jobs. \n\nIn December, health care added 39,000 jobs. Employment growth in hospitals (+32,000)\nand ambulatory health care services (+21,000) was partially offset by declines in \nnursing care facilities (-6,000) and community care facilities for the elderly (-5,000).\nHealth care employment is 502,000 lower than in February.\n\nIn December, manufacturing employment increased by 38,000, with gains in motor vehicles\nand parts (+7,000), plastics and rubber products (+7,000), and nonmetallic mineral \nproducts (+6,000). By contrast, miscellaneous nondurable goods manufacturing lost \n11,000 jobs over the month. Despite gains over the past 8 months, employment in \nmanufacturing is 543,000 below its February level.\n\nWholesale trade employment rose by 25,000 in December but is down by 251,000 since \nFebruary. In December, job gains occurred in durable goods (+11,000) and nondurable\ngoods (+11,000).\n\nIn December, employment changed little in other major industries, including mining,\ninformation, and financial activities.\n\nIn December, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls\nincreased by 23 cents to $29.81. Average hourly earnings of private-sector \nproduction and nonsupervisory employees increased by 20 cents to $25.09. These \nincreases largely reflect the disproportionate number of lower-paid workers in \nleisure and hospitality who went off payrolls, which put upward pressure on the \naverage hourly earnings estimates. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls declined by 0.1\nhour to 34.7 hours in December. In manufacturing, the workweek was unchanged at \n40.2 hours, and overtime increased by 0.1 hour to 3.3 hours. The average workweek\nfor production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was \nunchanged at 34.2 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for October was revised up by \n44,000, from +610,000 to +654,000, and the change for November was revised up by \n91,000, from +245,000 to +336,000. With these revisions, employment in October \nand November combined was 135,000 more than previously reported. (Monthly \nrevisions result from additional reports received from businesses and government\nagencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of \nseasonal factors.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for January is scheduled to be released on Friday, \nFebruary 5, 2021, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t      Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on December 2020 \t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t  Establishment and Household Survey Data\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Data collection for both surveys was affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. |\n| In the establishment survey, approximately one-fifth of the establishments are \t|\n| assigned to four regional data collection centers for collection. Although these \t|\n| centers were closed, interviewers at these centers worked remotely to collect data by |\n| telephone. Additionally, BLS encouraged businesses to report electronically. The \t|\n| collection rate for the establishment survey was 76 percent in December, about the \t|\n| same as the average for the 12 months ending in February 2020. The household survey \t|\n| is generally conducted through in-person and telephone interviews. However, for the \t|\n| safety of both interviewers and respondents, in-person interviews were conducted only |\n| when telephone interviews could not be done. The household survey response rate was \t|\n| 77 percent in December, considerably higher than the low of 65 percent in June but \t|\n| below the average of 83 percent for the 12 months ending in February 2020. \t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| In the establishment survey, workers who are paid by their employer for all or any \t|\n| part of the pay period including the 12th of the month are counted as employed, even \t|\n| if they were not actually at their jobs. Workers who are temporarily or permanently \t|\n| absent from their jobs and are not being paid are not counted as employed, even if \t|\n| they continue to receive benefits. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| In the household survey, individuals are classified as employed, unemployed, or not \t|\n| in the labor force based on their answers to a series of questions about their \t|\n| activities during the survey reference week (December 6th through December 12th). \t|\n| Workers who indicate they were not working during the entire survey reference week \t|\n| and expect to be recalled to their jobs should be classified as unemployed on \t|\n| temporary layoff. As in recent months, a large number of persons were classified as \t|\n| unemployed on temporary layoff in December.     \t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Since March, household survey interviewers have been instructed to classify employed \t|\n| persons absent from work due to temporary, coronavirus-related business closures or\t|\n| cutbacks as unemployed on temporary layoff. As in earlier months, some workers \t|\n| affected by the pandemic who should have been classified as unemployed on temporary \t|\n| layoff were instead misclassified as employed but not at work. However, the share of \t|\n| responses that may have been misclassified was highest in the early months of the \t|\n| pandemic and has been considerably lower in recent months.     \t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| For March through November, BLS published an estimate of what the unemployment rate \t|\n| would have been had misclassified workers been included among the unemployed. \t|\n| Repeating this same approach, the overall December unemployment rate would have been\t|\n| 0.6 percentage point higher than reported. However, this represents the upper bound \t|\n| of our estimate of misclassification and probably overstates the size of the \t\t|\n| misclassification error.   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| According to usual practice, the data from the household survey are accepted as \t|\n| recorded.

These \nimprovements in the labor market reflect the continued resumption of economic activity \nthat had been curtailed due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and efforts to \ncontain it. However, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated in recent\nmonths. In November, notable job gains occurred in transportation and warehousing, \nprofessional and business services, and health care. Employment declined in government \nand retail trade.\n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey \nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics.\nThe establishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry.\nFor more information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two \nsurveys, see the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn November, the unemployment rate edged down to 6.7 percent. The rate is down by 8.0 \npercentage points from its recent high in April but is 3.2 percentage points higher \nthan it was in February. The number of unemployed persons, at 10.7 million, continued \nto trend down in November but is 4.9 million higher than in February. (See table A-1. \nFor more information about how the household survey and its measures were affected by \nthe coronavirus pandemic, see the box note at the end of this news release.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for adult women (6.1 percent) \ndeclined in November. The jobless rates for adult men (6.7 percent), teenagers (14.0\npercent), Whites (5.9 percent), Blacks (10.3 percent), Asians (6.7 percent), and \nHispanics (8.4 percent) showed little or no change. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of persons on temporary layoff decreased by 441,000\nin November to 2.8 million. This measure is down considerably from the high of 18.1 \nmillion in April but is 2.0 million higher than its February level. The number of \npermanent job losers, at 3.7 million, was about unchanged in November but is 2.5 \nmillion higher than in February. (See table A-11.)\n\nIn November, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more)\nincreased by 385,000 to 3.9 million, accounting for 36.9 percent of the total \nunemployed, while the number of persons jobless 15 to 26 weeks declined by 760,000 to \n1.9 million. The number of persons jobless 5 to 14 weeks and persons jobless less than\n5 weeks showed little change in November at 2.4 million and 2.5 million, respectively.\n(See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate edged down to 61.5 percent in November; this is 1.9\npercentage points below its February level. The employment-population ratio, at 57.3\npercent, changed little over the month but is 3.8 percentage points lower than in \nFebruary. (See table A-1.)\n\nIn November, the number of persons who usually work full time rose by 752,000 to 124.3\nmillion, while the number of persons who usually work part time decreased by 779,000 \nto 25.4 million. (See table A-9.) \n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons was about unchanged over\nthe month at 6.7 million but remains 2.3 million higher than the February level. These\nindividuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time \nbecause their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. This\ngroup includes persons who usually work full time and persons who usually work part\ntime. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn November, the number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job \nincreased by 448,000 to 7.1 million; this measure is 2.2 million higher than in \nFebruary. These individuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not \nactively looking for work during the last 4 weeks or were unavailable to take a job.\n(See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who currently want a job, the number of persons \nmarginally attached to the labor force, at 2.1 million, changed little in November. \nThese individuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime\nin the prior 12 months but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.\nThe number of discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed \nthat no jobs were available for them, was 657,000 in November, little changed from \nthe previous month. (See Summary table A.)\n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data\n\nIn November, 21.8 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus \npandemic, up from 21.2 percent in October. These data refer to employed persons who\nteleworked or worked at home for pay at some point in the last 4 weeks specifically \nbecause of the pandemic.\n\nIn November, 14.8 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because\ntheir employer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not work\nat all or worked fewer hours at some point in the last 4 weeks due to the pandemic.\nThis measure is little changed from October. Among those who reported in November \nthat they were unable to work because of pandemic-related closures or lost business,\n13.7 percent received at least some pay from their employer for the hours not worked,\nup from 11.7 percent in October. \n\nAbout 3.9 million persons not in the labor force in November were prevented from \nlooking for work due to the pandemic. This measure is up from 3.6 million in October.\n(To be counted as unemployed, by definition, individuals must either be actively \nlooking for work or on temporary layoff.) \n\nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey beginning \nin May to help gauge the effects of the pandemic on the labor market. The data are \nnot seasonally adjusted. Tables with estimates from the supplemental questions for \nall months are available online at \nwww.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 245,000, following gains of larger magnitude\nin the prior 6 months. In November, nonfarm employment was below its February level\nby 9.8 million, or 6.5 percent. Notable job gains occurred over the month in \ntransportation and warehousing, professional and business services, and health care.\nEmployment declined in government and retail trade. (See table B-1. For more \ninformation about how the establishment survey and its measures were affected by the\ncoronavirus pandemic, see the box note at the end of this news release.)\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing rose by 145,000 in November but is \n123,000 below its February level. In November, employment rose by 82,000 in couriers\nand messengers and by 37,000 in warehousing and storage; since February, employment in\nthese industries has increased by 182,000 and 97,000, respectively. Job growth also \noccurred over the month in truck transportation (+13,000).\n\nIn November, employment in professional and business services increased by 60,000, \nwith about half the gain occurring in temporary help services (+32,000). Job growth \nalso occurred in services to buildings and dwellings (+14,000). Employment in \nprofessional and business services is down by 1.1 million since February.\n\nHealth care added 46,000 jobs in November, with gains occurring in offices of \nphysicians (+21,000), home health care services (+13,000), and offices of other health\npractitioners (+8,000). Nursing care facilities continued to lose jobs (-12,000). \nHealth care employment is 527,000 lower than in February. \n\nConstruction gained 27,000 jobs in November, but employment is 279,000 below its \nFebruary level. In November, employment rose in residential specialty trade contractors\n(+14,000) and in heavy and civil engineering construction (+10,000).\n\nIn November, manufacturing employment increased by 27,000. Job gains occurred in motor \nvehicles and parts (+15,000) and in plastics and rubber products (+5,000). Employment\nin manufacturing was 599,000 lower than in February.\n\nFinancial activities added 15,000 jobs in November. Gains occurred in real estate \n(+10,000) and in nondepository credit intermediation (+8,000). Financial activities has\nadded 164,000 jobs over the past 7 months, but employment in the industry is 115,000 \nlower than in February.\n\nEmployment in wholesale trade continued to trend up in November (+10,000) but is \n281,000 lower than in February. \n\nGovernment employment declined for the third consecutive month, decreasing by 99,000 in\nNovember. A decline of 86,000 in federal government employment reflected the loss of \n93,000 temporary workers who had been hired for the 2020 Census. Employment in local \ngovernment education continued to trend down (-21,000). \n\nIn November, retail trade lost 35,000 jobs, reflecting less seasonal hiring in several \nretail industries. Employment decreases occurred in general merchandise stores \n(-21,000); sporting goods, hobby, book, and music stores (-12,000); electronics and \nappliance stores (-11,000); and health and personal care stores (-8,000). By contrast, \nfurniture and home furnishings stores and automobile dealers added 6,000 jobs and 4,000\njobs, respectively. Employment in retail trade is 550,000 lower than in February. \n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality changed little in November (+31,000) but is down\nby 3.4 million since February. Arts, entertainment, and recreation added 43,000 jobs in\nNovember, while employment in food services and drinking places changed little (-17,000).\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including mining, information, and other services,\nshowed little change in November.\n\nIn November, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls \nincreased by 9 cents to $29.58. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and\nnonsupervisory employees increased by 7 cents to $24.87. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls remained unchanged \nat 34.8 hours in November. In manufacturing, the workweek decreased by 0.2 hour to 40.3\nhours, and overtime decreased by 0.1 hour to 3.1 hours. The average workweek for \nproduction and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at \n34.2 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for September was revised up by 39,000, \nfrom +672,000 to +711,000, and the change for October was revised down by 28,000, from \n+638,000 to +610,000. With these revisions, employment in September and October combined\nwas 11,000 more than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional \nreports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published \nestimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.)\n\n____________\nThe Employment Situation for December is scheduled to be released on Friday, January 8,\n2021, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\tCoronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on November 2020\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t    Establishment and Household Survey Data\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Data collection for both surveys was affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. |\n| In the establishment survey, approximately one-fifth of the establishments are \t|\n| assigned to four regional data collection centers for collection.

The \t|\n| collection rate for the establishment survey was 74 percent in November, about the \t|\n| same as the average for the 12 months ending in February 2020. The household survey \t|\n| is generally conducted through in-person and telephone interviews. However, for the \t|\n| safety of both interviewers and respondents, in-person interviews were conducted only |\n| when telephone interviews could not be done. The household survey response rate was \t|\n| 79 percent in November, considerably higher than the low of 65 percent in June but \t|\n| below the average of 83 percent for the 12 months ending in February 2020.\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| In the establishment survey, workers who are paid by their employer for all or any \t|\n| part of the pay period including the 12th of the month are counted as employed, even \t|\n| if they were not actually at their jobs.

    "2020-10": "Transmission of material in this news release is embargoed until\t         USDL-20-2033\n8:30 a.m. (ET) Friday, November 6, 2020\n\nTechnical information: \n Household data:\tcpsinfo@bls.gov  *  www.bls.gov/cps\n Establishment data:\tcesinfo@bls.gov  *  www.bls.gov/ces\n\nMedia contact:\t(202) 691-5902  *  PressOffice@bls.gov\n\n\t\n                    THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION -- OCTOBER 2020\n\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 638,000 in October, and the unemployment rate\ndeclined to 6.9 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. These\nimprovements in the labor market reflect the continued resumption of economic activity\nthat had been curtailed due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and efforts to contain\nit. In October, notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, professional and\nbusiness services, retail trade, and construction. Employment in government declined.\n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey\nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The\nestablishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. For\nmore information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two surveys,\nsee the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn October, the unemployment rate declined by 1.0 percentage point to 6.9 percent, and\nthe number of unemployed persons fell by 1.5 million to 11.1 million. Both measures have\ndeclined for 6 consecutive months but are nearly twice their February levels (3.5 percent\nand 5.8 million, respectively). (See table A-1. For more information about how the\nhousehold survey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic, see the box\nnote at the end of this news release.)\n\nUnemployment rates declined among all major worker groups in October. The rate was 6.7\npercent for adult men, 6.5 percent for adult women, 13.9 percent for teenagers, 6.0 percent\nfor Whites, 10.8 percent for Blacks, 7.6 percent for Asians, and 8.8 percent for Hispanics.\n(See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of persons on temporary layoff fell by 1.4 million to 3.2\nmillion. This measure is down considerably from the high of 18.1 million in April but is 2.4\nmillion higher than in February. The number of permanent job losers, at 3.7 million in October,\nchanged little over the month but is 2.4 million higher than in February. (See table A-11.)\n\nIn October, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) increased\nby 1.2 million to 3.6 million, accounting for 32.5 percent of the total unemployed. By contrast,\nthe number of unemployed persons jobless 15 to 26 weeks decreased by 2.3 million to 2.6 million,\nand the number of persons jobless 5 to 14 weeks decreased by 457,000 to 2.3 million. The number\nof persons who were jobless less than 5 weeks was about unchanged at 2.5 million. (See table\nA-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate increased by 0.3 percentage point to 61.7 percent in October;\nthis is 1.7 percentage points below the February level. The employment-population ratio increased\nby 0.8 percentage point to 57.4 percent in October but is 3.7 percentage points lower than in\nFebruary. (See table A-1.)\n\nIn October, the number of persons who usually work full time rose by 1.2 million to 123.6 million,\nand the number who usually work part time increased by 1.0 million to 26.2 million. (See table\nA-9.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons increased by 383,000 to 6.7 million\nin October, after declines totaling 4.6 million over the prior 5 months. These individuals, who would\nhave preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been reduced\nor they were unable to find full-time jobs. This group includes persons who usually work full\ntime and persons who usually work part time. (See table A-8.)\n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job decreased by 539,000 to\n6.7 million in October; this measure is 1.7 million higher than in February. These individuals\nwere not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work during the last\n4 weeks or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who currently want a job, the number of persons marginally\nattached to the labor force, at 2.0 million, was about unchanged in October. These individuals\nwere not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime\nin the prior 12 months but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number\nof discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available\nfor them, was 588,000 in October, essentially unchanged from the previous month. (See Summary\ntable A.) \n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data \n\nIn October, 21.2 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus pandemic, down\nfrom 22.7 percent in September. These data refer to employed persons who teleworked or worked at\nhome for pay at some point in the last 4 weeks specifically because of the pandemic. \n\nIn October, 15.1 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because their employer\nclosed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not work at all or worked fewer \nhours at some point in the last 4 weeks due to the pandemic. This measure is down from 19.4 million\nin September. Among those who reported in October that they were unable to work because of pandemic-\nrelated closures or lost business, 11.7 percent received at least some pay from their employer for\nthe hours not worked, up from 10.3 percent in September. \n\t\t\t\t\nAbout 3.6 million persons not in the labor force in October were prevented from looking for work\ndue to the pandemic. This is down from 4.5 million in September. (To be counted as unemployed,\nby definition, individuals must either be actively looking for work or on temporary layoff.) \n\nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey beginning in May to help\ngauge the effects of the pandemic on the labor market. The data are not seasonally adjusted. Tables\nwith estimates from the supplemental questions for all months are available online at \nwww.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm. \n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 638,000 in October and has increased for 6 consecutive\nmonths. In October, nonfarm employment was below its February level by 10.1 million, or 6.6 \npercent. Notable job gains occurred over the month in leisure and hospitality, professional and\nbusiness services, retail trade, and construction. Employment in government declined. (See table\nB-1. For more information about how the establishment survey and its measures were affected by\nthe coronavirus pandemic, see the box note at the end of this news release.)\n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality increased by 271,000 in October, with gains in food services\nand drinking places (+192,000); arts, entertainment, and recreation (+44,000); and accommodation\n(+34,000). Leisure and hospitality has added 4.8 million jobs since April, but employment in the\nindustry is down by 3.5 million since February. \n\nProfessional and business services added 208,000 jobs in October, with temporary help services\n(+109,000) accounting for about half of the gain. Employment also increased in services to buildings\nand dwellings (+19,000), computer systems design and related services (+16,000), and management \nand technical consulting services (+15,000). Employment in professional and business services is\n1.1 million below its February level.\n\nIn October, retail trade added 104,000 jobs, with almost one-third of the gain in electronics and\nappliance stores (+31,000). Employment also rose in motor vehicle and parts dealers (+23,000),\nfurniture and home furnishings stores (+14,000), clothing and clothing accessories stores (+13,000),\ngeneral merchandise stores (+10,000), and nonstore retailers (+9,000). Employment in retail trade\nhas risen by 1.9 million since April but is 499,000 below its February level.\n\nConstruction added 84,000 jobs in October. Specialty trade contractors added jobs, both in the\nnonresidential (+28,000) and residential (+18,000) components. Employment also rose in heavy and\ncivil engineering construction and in construction of buildings (+19,000 each). Construction has\nadded 789,000 jobs in the last 6 months, but employment is down by 294,000 since February.\n\nEmployment in health care and social assistance rose by 79,000 in October but is down by 950,000\nsince February. In October, health care employment increased by 58,000, with the largest gains\noccurring in hospitals (+16,000), offices of physicians (+14,000), offices of dentists (+11,000),\nand outpatient care centers (+10,000). These increases were partially offset by a decline of 9,000\nin nursing and residential care facilities. Social assistance added 21,000 jobs over the month. \n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing increased by 63,000 in October, with gains occurring\nin warehousing and storage (+28,000), transit and ground passenger transportation (+25,000), and\ntruck transportation (+10,000). By contrast, air transportation shed 18,000 jobs. Employment in\ntransportation and warehousing is 271,000 below its February level.\n\nThe other services industry added 47,000 jobs in October, with gains occurring in personal and\nlaundry services (+27,000) and in repair and maintenance (+18,000). Employment in other services\nis 436,000 below its February level.\n\nManufacturing employment rose by 38,000 in October but is 621,000 lower than in February. Gains\noccurred in fabricated metal products (+7,000), primary metals (+6,000), and wood products\n(+4,000). Employment continued to trend up in food manufacturing (+6,000) and in plastics and\nrubber products (+4,000). \n\nEmployment in financial activities rose by 31,000 in October but is 129,000 lower than in February.\nOver-the-month job gains occurred in finance and insurance (+17,000) and real estate (+10,000). \n\nIn October, government employment fell by 268,000. A decrease of 138,000 in federal government was\ndriven by a loss of 147,000 temporary 2020 Census workers. Job losses also occurred in local \ngovernment education and state government education (-98,000 and -61,000, respectively).\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including mining, wholesale trade, and information, changed\nlittle in October. \n\nIn October, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 4\ncents to $29.50. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees\nrose by 5 cents to $24.82. The large employment fluctuations over the past several months--especially\nin industries with lower-paid workers--complicate the analysis of recent trends in average hourly\nearnings. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.8 hours in\nOctober. In manufacturing, the workweek increased by 0.3 hour to 40.5 hours, and overtime rose by\n0.2 hour to 3.2 hours. The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees increased\nby 0.1 hour to 34.2 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for August was revised up by 4,000 from +1,489,000\nto +1,493,000, and the change for September was revised up by 11,000 from +661,000 to +672,000.\nWith these revisions, employment in August and September combined was 15,000 higher than previously\nreported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses and government\nagencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for November is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, December 4, 2020, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n  ________________________________________________________________________________________           \n |           \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  |\n |            Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on October 2020 Establishment\t\t  |\n |                              and Household Survey Data                \t\t  |\n |  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  |\n | Data collection for both surveys was affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.  |\n | In the establishment survey, approximately one-fifth of the establishments are\t  |\n | assigned to four regional data collection centers for collection.

In September, notable job gains occurred in leisure and \nhospitality, in retail trade, in health care and social assistance, and in \nprofessional and business services. Employment in government declined over the month,\nmainly in state and local government education.\n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey\nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics.\nThe establishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry.\nFor more information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these \ntwo surveys, see the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn September, the unemployment rate declined by 0.5 percentage point to 7.9 percent,\nand the number of unemployed persons fell by 1.0 million to 12.6 million. Both \nmeasures have declined for 5 consecutive months but are higher than in February, by\n4.4 percentage points and 6.8 million, respectively. (See table A-1. For more \ninformation about how the household survey and its measures were affected by the \ncoronavirus pandemic, see the box note at the end of this news release.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates declined in September for adult\nmen (7.4 percent), adult women (7.7 percent), Whites (7.0 percent), and Asians \n(8.9 percent). The jobless rates for teenagers (15.9 percent), Blacks (12.1 percent),\nand Hispanics (10.3 percent) showed little change over the month. (See tables A-1,\nA-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of persons on temporary layoff decreased by 1.5 \nmillion in September to 4.6 million. This measure is down considerably from the high\nof 18.1 million in April but is 3.8 million higher than in February. In September, \nthe number of permanent job losers increased by 345,000 to 3.8 million; this measure\nhas risen by 2.5 million since February. The number of unemployed job leavers rose by\n212,000 to 801,000 in September. (Job leavers are persons who quit or voluntarily \nleft their previous job and immediately began looking for new employment.) (See table\nA-11.)\n\nIn September, the number of unemployed persons who were jobless less than 5 weeks\nincreased by 271,000 to 2.6 million. The number of persons jobless 5 to 14 weeks \ndecreased by 402,000 to 2.7 million, and the number of persons jobless 15 to 26 weeks\nfell by 1.6 million to 4.9 million. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless\nfor 27 weeks or more) increased by 781,000 to 2.4 million. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate decreased by 0.3 percentage point to 61.4 percent\nin September and is 2.0 percentage points lower than in February. The employment-\npopulation ratio, at 56.6 percent, changed little over the month but is 4.5 percentage\npoints lower than in February. (See table A-1.)\n\nIn September, the number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes\nreferred to as involuntary part-time workers) declined by 1.3 million to 6.3 million,\nreflecting a decrease in the number of persons whose hours were cut due to slack work\nor business conditions. The number of involuntary part-time workers is 2.0 million\nhigher than in February. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time \nemployment, were working part time because their hours had been reduced or they were\nunable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job, at 7.2 million,\nchanged little in September; this measure is 2.3 million higher than in February. \nThese individuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively \nlooking for work during the last 4 weeks or were unavailable to take a job. (See \ntable A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who currently want a job, the number of persons \nmarginally attached to the labor force, at 1.9 million, changed little in September. \nThese individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and \nhad looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not looked for work in the\n4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a subset of the \nmarginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them, was 581,000 in \nSeptember, also little changed from the previous month. (See Summary table A.)\n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data \n\nIn September, 22.7 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus\npandemic, down from 24.3 percent in August. These data refer to employed persons who \nteleworked or worked at home for pay at some point in the last 4 weeks specifically \nbecause of the pandemic. \n\nIn September, 19.4 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because \ntheir employer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not work\nat all or worked fewer hours at some point in the last 4 weeks due to the pandemic. \nThis measure is down from 24.2 million in August. Among those who reported in \nSeptember that they were unable to work because of pandemic-related closures or lost \nbusiness, 10.3 percent received at least some pay from their employer for the hours not\nworked. \n\nAbout 4.5 million persons not in the labor force in September were prevented from \nlooking for work due to the pandemic. This is down from 5.2 million in August. (To be\ncounted as unemployed, by definition, individuals must either be actively looking for\nwork or on temporary layoff.) \n\nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey beginning in\nMay to help gauge the effects of the pandemic on the labor market. The data are not \nseasonally adjusted. Tables with estimates from the supplemental questions for all \nmonths are available online at \nwww.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 661,000 in September, following larger gains\nin the prior 4 months. In September, nonfarm employment was below its February level\nby 10.7 million, or 7.0 percent. Notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality,\nin retail trade, in health care and social assistance, and in professional and business\nservices. Employment declined in government, mainly in state and local government \neducation. (See table B-1. For more information about how the establishment survey and\nits measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic, see the box note at the end of \nthis news release.)\n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality increased by 318,000 in September, with almost \ntwo-thirds of the gain occurring in food services and drinking places (+200,000). \nDespite job growth totaling 3.8 million over the last 5 months, employment in food \nservices and drinking places is down by 2.3 million since February. Amusements, \ngambling, and recreation (+69,000) and accommodation (+51,000) also added jobs in \nSeptember.\n\nRetail trade added 142,000 jobs over the month, with gains widespread in the industry.\nClothing and clothing accessories stores (+40,000) accounted for about one-fourth of \nthe over-the-month change in retail trade. Notable employment increases also occurred \nin general merchandise stores (+20,000), motor vehicle and parts dealers (+16,000), and\nhealth and personal care stores (+16,000). Employment in retail trade is 483,000 lower\nthan in February.\n\nEmployment in health care and social assistance rose by 108,000 in September but is \ndown by 1.0 million since February. Health care added 53,000 jobs in September, with \ncontinued growth in offices of physicians (+18,000), home health care services \n(+16,000), and offices of other health practitioners (+14,000). Social assistance added\n55,000 jobs, mostly in individual and family services (+32,000) and in child day care \nservices (+18,000).\n\nProfessional and business services added 89,000 jobs in September. Employment increased\nin services to buildings and dwellings (+22,000), architectural and engineering \nservices (+13,000), and computer systems design and related services (+12,000). Despite\ngains of 910,000 since April, employment in professional and business services is 1.4\nmillion lower than in February. \n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing rose by 74,000 in September. Within the\nindustry, job gains continued in warehousing and storage (+32,000), transit and ground\npassenger transportation (+21,000), and couriers and messengers (+10,000). Although the\nindustry has added 291,000 jobs since May, employment in transportation and warehousing\nis 304,000 lower than in February. \n\nManufacturing added 66,000 jobs over the month. Durable goods accounted for about two-\nthirds of the gain, led by motor vehicles and parts (+14,000) and machinery (+14,000).\nDespite gains over the past 5 months, employment in manufacturing is 647,000 below \nFebruary's level. \n\nFinancial activities added 37,000 jobs in September. Job growth occurred in real estate\nand rental and leasing (+20,000) and in finance and insurance (+16,000). Employment in\nfinancial activities is 162,000 below the level in February.\n\nIn September, the other services industry added 36,000 jobs, largely in membership\nassociations and organizations (+31,000). Employment in other services is 495,000 \nlower than in February.\n\nEmployment in information grew by 27,000 in September but is down by 276,000 since\nFebruary. Motion picture and sound recording industries accounted for most of the \nSeptember gain (+23,000). \n\nConstruction employment increased by 26,000 in September, with growth in residential\nspecialty trade contractors (+16,000) and construction of buildings (+12,000). \nConstruction employment is below its February level by 394,000.\n\nIn September, wholesale trade added 19,000 jobs, with gains in both the durable and\nnondurable goods components (+13,000 and +8,000, respectively). Employment in \nwholesale trade is 312,000 lower than in February. \n\nGovernment employment declined by 216,000 in September. Employment in local \ngovernment education and state government education fell by 231,000 and 49,000, \nrespectively. A decrease of 34,000 in federal government was driven by a decline in\nthe number of temporary Census 2020 workers. Partially offsetting these declines, \nemployment in local government, excluding education, rose by 96,000.\n\nEmployment in private education decreased by 69,000 in September, after a gain of \nsimilar magnitude in August. Employment in the industry is down by 355,000 since \nFebruary. \n\nEmployment changed little in mining in September (+1,000). Employment in the \nindustry is down by 133,000 since a recent peak in January 2019; about three-fourths\nof this decline has occurred since February of this year. \n\nIn September, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls,\nat $29.47, changed little (+2 cents). Average hourly earnings of private-sector \nproduction and nonsupervisory employees were also little changed in September \n(+1 cent) at $24.79. The large employment fluctuations over the past several months--\nespecially in industries with lower-paid workers--complicate the analysis of recent\ntrends in average hourly earnings. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)  \n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 0.1 hour\nto 34.7 hours in September. In manufacturing, the workweek rose by 0.2 hour to 40.2\nhours, and overtime decreased by 0.1 hour to 2.9 hours. The average workweek for\nproduction and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 0.1 hour\nto 34.1 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for July was revised up by 27,000,\nfrom +1,734,000 to +1,761,000, and the change for August was revised up by 118,000,\nfrom +1,371,000 to +1,489,000. With these revisions, employment in July and August \ncombined was 145,000 more than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from\nadditional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last \npublished estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for October is scheduled to be released on Friday, November 6,\n2020, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|                    Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on September 2020                    |\n|\t\t\t Establishment and Household Survey Data    \t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Data collection for both surveys was affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. |\n| In the establishment survey, approximately one-fifth of the establishments are \t|\n| assigned to four regional data collection centers for collection. Although these \t|\n| centers were closed, interviewers at these centers worked remotely to collect data by |\n| telephone. Additionally, BLS encouraged businesses to report electronically. The \t|\n| collection rate for the establishment survey was 70 percent in September, 5 \t\t|\n| percentage points lower than the average for the 12 months ending in February 2020.\t|\n| The household survey is generally conducted through in-person and telephone \t\t|\n| interviews. However, for the safety of both interviewers and respondents, in-person \t|\n| interviews were conducted only when telephone interviews could not be done. The \t|\n| household survey response rate was 79 percent in September, considerably higher than\t|\n| the low of 65 percent in June but below the average rate of 83 percent for the 12 \t|\n| months ending in February 2020.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| In the establishment survey, workers who are paid by their employer for all or any \t|\n| part of the pay period including the 12th of the month are counted as employed, even  |\n| if they were not actually at their jobs.

Most major series,\nincluding the official unemployment rate, were not affected. Estimates in the BLS online \ndatabase were corrected for January\u2013July 2020. For more information on these corrections, see\nwww.bls.gov/bls/errata/revision-to-current-population-survey-estimates-for-January-through-\nJuly-2020.htm.)\n\n\t\n\t\t\t       THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION -- AUGUST 2020\n\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 1.4 million in August, and the unemployment rate fell to\n8.4 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. These improvements in the labor\nmarket reflect the continued resumption of economic activity that had been curtailed due to the\ncoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and efforts to contain it. In August, an increase in government\nemployment largely reflected temporary hiring for the 2020 Census. Notable job gains also \noccurred in retail trade, in professional and business services, in leisure and hospitality, and\nin education and health services.\n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey measures\nlabor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The establishment\nsurvey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. For more information about \nthe concepts and statistical methodology used in these two surveys, see the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n \nIn August, the unemployment rate declined by 1.8 percentage points to 8.4 percent, and the number\nof unemployed persons fell by 2.8 million to 13.6 million. Both measures have declined for 4 \nconsecutive months but are higher than in February, by 4.9 percentage points and 7.8 million, \nrespectively. (See table A-1. For more information about how the household survey and its \nmeasures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic, see the box note at the end of this news\nrelease.) \n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates declined in August for adult men (8.0 \npercent), adult women (8.4 percent), teenagers (16.1 percent), Whites (7.3 percent), Blacks (13.0\npercent), and Hispanics (10.5 percent). The jobless rate for Asians (10.7 percent) changed \nlittle over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of persons on temporary layoff decreased by 3.1 million in\nAugust to 6.2 million, down considerably from the series high of 18.1 million in April. In August,\nthe number of permanent job losers increased by 534,000 to 3.4 million; this measure has risen by\n2.1 million since February. The number of unemployed reentrants to the labor force declined by \n263,000 to 2.1 million. (Reentrants are persons who previously worked but were not in the labor \nforce prior to beginning their job search.) (See table A-11.) \n\nThe number of unemployed persons who were jobless less than 5 weeks decreased by 921,000 to 2.3 \nmillion in August, and the number of persons jobless 5 to 14 weeks fell by 2.0 million to 3.1 \nmillion. The long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) numbered 1.6 million,\nlittle changed over the month. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate increased by 0.3 percentage point to 61.7 percent in August\nbut is 1.7 percentage points below its February level. Total employment, as measured by the \nhousehold survey, rose by 3.8 million in August to 147.3 million. The employment-population ratio\nrose by 1.4 percentage points to 56.5 percent but is 4.6 percentage points lower than in \nFebruary. (See table A-1.) \n\nIn August, the number of persons who usually work full time rose by 2.8 million to 122.4 million,\nand the number who usually work part time increased by 991,000 to 25.0 million. Part-time \nworkers accounted for about one-fourth of the over-the-month employment gain. (See table A-9.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as \ninvoluntary part-time workers) declined by 871,000 to 7.6 million in August, reflecting a decrease\nin the number of people who worked part time due to slack work or business conditions (-1.1 \nmillion). The number of involuntary part-time workers is 3.3 million higher than in February. \nThese individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because\ntheir hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. This group includes \npersons who usually work full time and persons who usually work part time. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn August, the number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job declined by \n747,000 to 7.0 million; this measure is 2.0 million higher than in February. These individuals \nwere not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work during the last 4\nweeks or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who currently want a job, the number of persons marginally \nattached to the labor force, at 2.1 million, changed little in August. These individuals had not\nactively looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey but wanted a job, were available \nfor work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. The number of discouraged\nworkers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them,\ndecreased by 130,000 in August to 535,000. (See Summary table A.)\n\nHousehold Survey Supplemental Data \n\nIn August, 24.3 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus pandemic, down\nfrom 26.4 percent in July. These data refer to employed persons who teleworked or worked at home\nfor pay at some point in the last 4 weeks specifically because of the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nIn August, 24.2 million persons reported that they had been unable to work because their \nemployer closed or lost business due to the pandemic--that is, they did not work at all or \nworked fewer hours at some point in the last 4 weeks due to the pandemic. This measure is down \nfrom 31.3 million in July. Among those who reported in August that they were unable to work \nbecause of pandemic-related closures or lost business, 11.6 percent received at least some pay \nfrom their employer for the hours not worked.  \n\nAbout 5.2 million persons not in the labor force in August were prevented from looking for work \ndue to the pandemic. This is down from 6.5 million in July. (To be counted as unemployed, by \ndefinition, individuals must either be actively looking for work or on temporary layoff.)\n\nThese supplemental data come from questions added to the household survey beginning in May to \nhelp gauge the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the labor market. The data are not \nseasonally adjusted. Tables with estimates from the supplemental questions for all months are \navailable online at www.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm. \n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 1.4 million in August, following increases of larger \nmagnitude in the prior 3 months. In August, nonfarm employment was below its February level by\n11.5 million, or 7.6 percent. Government employment rose in August, largely reflecting temporary\nhiring for the 2020 Census. Notable job gains also occurred in retail trade, in professional and\nbusiness services, in leisure and hospitality, and in education and health services. (See table\nB-1. For more information about how the establishment survey and its measures were affected by \nthe coronavirus pandemic, see the box note at the end of this news release.)\n\nEmployment in government increased by 344,000 in August, accounting for one-fourth of the over-\nthe-month gain in total nonfarm employment. A job gain in federal government (+251,000) reflected\nthe hiring of 238,000 temporary 2020 Census workers. Local government employment rose by 95,000 \nover the month. Overall, government employment is 831,000 below its February level. \n\nRetail trade added 249,000 jobs in August, with almost half the growth occurring in general \nmerchandise stores (+116,000). Notable gains also occurred in motor vehicle and parts dealers \n(+22,000), electronics and appliance stores (+21,000), and miscellaneous store retailers \n(+17,000). Employment in retail trade is 655,000 lower than in February.\n\nIn August, employment in professional and business services increased by 197,000. More than half\nof the gain occurred in temporary help services (+107,000). Architectural and engineering \nservices (+14,000), business support services (+13,000), and computer systems design and related\nservices (+13,000) also added jobs over the month. Employment in professional and business \nservices is 1.5 million below its February level.\n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality increased by 174,000 in August, with about three-fourths \nof the gain occurring in food services and drinking places (+134,000). Despite job gains \ntotaling 3.6 million over the last 4 months, employment in food services and drinking places is \ndown by 2.5 million since February. \n\nIn August, employment in education and health services increased by 147,000 but is 1.5 million\nbelow February's level. Health care employment increased by 75,000 over the month, with gains in\noffices of physicians (+27,000), offices of dentists (+22,000), hospitals (+14,000), and home\nhealth care services (+12,000). Elsewhere in health care, job losses continued in nursing and \nresidential care facilities (-14,000). Employment in private education rose by 57,000 over the\nmonth.\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing rose by 78,000 in August, with gains in warehousing\nand storage (+34,000), transit and ground passenger transportation (+11,000), and truck \ntransportation (+10,000). Employment in transportation and warehousing is down by 381,000 since\nFebruary.\n\nThe other services industry added 74,000 jobs in August, reflecting gains in membership \nassociations and organizations (+31,000), repair and maintenance (+29,000), and personal and\nlaundry services (+14,000). Employment in other services is 531,000 lower than in February.\n\nFinancial activities added 36,000 jobs in August, with most of the growth in real estate and\nrental and leasing (+23,000). Employment in financial activities is down by 191,000 since\nFebruary.\n\nIn August, manufacturing employment rose by 29,000, with gains concentrated in the nondurable \ngoods component (+27,000). Despite gains in recent months, employment in manufacturing is \n720,000 below February's level.\n\nEmployment in wholesale trade increased by 14,000 in August, reflecting an increase of 9,000\nin the nondurable goods component. Wholesale trade employment has declined by 328,000 since \nFebruary.\n\nIn August, employment changed little in mining, construction, and information. \n\nIn August, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 11\ncents to $29.47. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory \nemployees increased by 18 cents to $24.81, following a decrease of 10 cents in the prior month.\nThe large employment fluctuations over the past several months--especially in industries with\nlower-paid workers--complicate the analysis of recent trends in average hourly earnings. (See\ntables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.1 hour to \n34.6 hours in August. In manufacturing, the workweek rose by 0.3 hour to 40.0 hours, and \novertime increased by 0.1 hour to 3.0 hours. The average workweek for production and \nnonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.0 hours. (See tables\nB-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for June was revised down by 10,000, from \n+4,791,000 to +4,781,000, and the change for July was revised down by 29,000, from +1,763,000\nto +1,734,000. With these revisions, employment in June and July combined was 39,000 less than\npreviously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses\nand government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of \nseasonal factors.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for September is scheduled to be released on Friday, October 2, 2020,\nat 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|     Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on August 2020 Establishment and Household Survey Data      |\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Data collection for both surveys was affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

The household survey is generally conducted through in-person and telephone interviews. |\n| However, for the safety of both interviewers and respondents, the vast majority of interviews |\n| were done by telephone, with in-person interviews conducted on a limited basis in some areas  |\n| of the country. The household survey response rate was 70 percent in August, up from the low  |\n| of 65 percent in June but well below the average rate of 83 percent for the 12 months prior   |\n| to the pandemic. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| In the establishment survey, workers who are paid by their employer for all or any part of \t|\n| the pay period including the 12th of the month are counted as employed, even if they were not |\n| actually at their jobs.

These\nimprovements in the labor market reflected the continued resumption of economic\nactivity that had been curtailed due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and\nefforts to contain it. In July, notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality,\ngovernment, retail trade, professional and business services, other services, and \nhealth care.\n \nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey\nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics.\nThe establishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry.\nFor more information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two\nsurveys, see the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn July, the unemployment rate declined by 0.9 percentage point to 10.2 percent, and\nthe number of unemployed persons fell by 1.4 million to 16.3 million. Despite declines\nover the past 3 months, these measures are up by 6.7 percentage points and 10.6 million,\nrespectively, since February. (See table A-1. For more information about how the\nhousehold survey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic, see the\nbox note at the end of this news release.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates declined in July for adult men\n(9.4 percent), adult women (10.5 percent), teenagers (19.3 percent), Whites (9.2 percent),\nAsians (12.0 percent), and Hispanics (12.9 percent). The jobless rate for Blacks (14.6\npercent) showed little change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of unemployed persons who were on temporary layoff decreased by 1.3 million\nin July to 9.2 million, about half its April level. In July, the number of permanent\njob losers and the number of unemployed reentrants to the labor force were virtually\nunchanged over the month, at 2.9 million and 2.4 million, respectively. (Reentrants\nare persons who previously worked but were not in the labor force prior to beginning\ntheir job search.) (See table A-11.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, those who were jobless less than 5 weeks increased by 364,000 to\n3.2 million in July, and the number of persons jobless 15 to 26 weeks rose by 4.6 million\nto 6.5 million. By contrast, the number of unemployed persons who were jobless 5 to 14\nweeks fell by 6.3 million to 5.2 million. The number of long-term unemployed (those\njobless for 27 weeks or more), at 1.5 million, was little changed over the month. (See\ntable A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate, at 61.4 percent, changed little in July, following\nincreases in May and June. Total employment, as measured by the household survey, rose\nby 1.4 million in July to 143.5 million. The employment-population ratio rose by 0.5\npercentage point to 55.1 percent but remains lower than in February (61.1 percent).\n(See table A-1.)\n\nIn July, the number of persons who usually work part time rose by 803,000 to 24.0 million,\nwhile the number who usually work full time, at 119.5 million, was little changed. (See\ntable A-9.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to\nas involuntary part-time workers) declined by 619,000 to 8.4 million in July, reflecting\na decline in the number of people whose hours were cut due to slack work or business\nconditions (-658,000). The number of involuntary part-time workers is 4.1 million higher\nthan in February. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were\nworking part time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-\ntime jobs. This group includes persons who usually work full time and persons who usually\nwork part time. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn July, the number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job declined\nby 463,000 to 7.7 million; this measure is 2.8 million higher than in February. These\nindividuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for\nwork during the last 4 weeks or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong those not in the labor force who currently want a job, persons marginally attached\nto the labor force fell by 492,000 to 2.0 million in July. These individuals were not\nin the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime\nin the prior 12 months but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.\nDiscouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were\navailable for them, numbered 665,000 in July, essentially unchanged from the previous month.\n(See Summary table A.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 1.8 million in July, less than the increases of\n4.8 million in June and 2.7 million in May. In July, nonfarm employment was lower than\nits February level by 12.9 million, or 8.4 percent. The largest employment increases in\nJuly occurred in leisure and hospitality, government, retail trade, professional and\nbusiness services, other services, and health care. (See table B-1. For more information\nabout how the establishment survey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus\npandemic, see the box note at the end of this news release.)\n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality increased by 592,000, accounting for about one-third\nof the gain in total nonfarm employment in July. Employment in food services and drinking\nplaces rose by 502,000, following gains of 2.9 million in May and June combined. Despite\nthe gains over the last 3 months, employment in food services and drinking places is down\nby 2.6 million since February. Over the month, employment also rose in amusements,\ngambling, and recreation (+100,000). \n\nGovernment employment rose by 301,000 in July but is 1.1 million below its February level.\nTypically, public-sector education employment declines in July (before seasonal adjustment).\nHowever, employment declines occurred earlier than usual this year due to the pandemic,\nresulting in unusually large July increases in local government education (+215,000) and\nstate government education (+30,000) after seasonal adjustment. A July job gain in federal\ngovernment (+27,000) reflected the hiring of temporary workers for the 2020 Census. \n\nIn July, retail trade added 258,000 jobs. Employment in the industry is 913,000 lower than\nin February. In July, nearly half of the job gain in retail trade occurred in clothing and\nclothing accessories stores (+121,000). By contrast, the component of general merchandise\nstores that includes warehouse clubs and supercenters lost jobs (-64,000). \n\nEmployment in professional and business services increased in July (+170,000) but remains\n1.6 million below its February level. The majority of July's gain occurred in temporary\nhelp services (+144,000). \n\nIn July, the other services industry added 149,000 jobs, with most of the increase occurring\nin personal and laundry services (+119,000). Since February, employment in other services is\ndown by 627,000.\n\nIn July, health care added 126,000 jobs, with employment growth in offices of dentists\n(+45,000), hospitals (+27,000), offices of physicians (+26,000), and home health care services\n(+16,000). Job losses continued in nursing and residential care facilities (-28,000).\nEmployment in health care is down by 797,000 since February.\n\nIn July, employment in social assistance increased by 66,000, with child day care services\naccounting for most of the gain (+45,000). Employment in social assistance is 460,000 lower\nthan in February. \n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing rose by 38,000 in July, following an increase\nof 87,000 in June. Despite job gains over the past 2 months, employment in the industry is\ndown by 470,000 since a recent peak in January. In July, employment rose in transit and\nground passenger transportation (+20,000), air transportation (+16,000), and couriers and\nmessengers (+9,000). \n\nManufacturing employment increased by 26,000 in July. An employment gain in motor vehicles\nand parts (+39,000) was partially offset by losses in fabricated metal products (-11,000),\nmachinery (-7,000), and computer and electronic products (-6,000). Although manufacturing\nhas added 623,000 jobs over the past 3 months, employment is 740,000 lower than in February.\n\nFinancial activities added 21,000 jobs in July, with most of the gain in real estate and\nrental and leasing (+15,000). Since February, employment in financial activities is down\nby 216,000.\n\nIn July, construction employment changed little (+20,000), following job gains of 619,000\nin May and June combined. However, employment in the industry remains 444,000 below its \nFebruary level. \n\nMining continued to shed jobs in July (-7,000), reflecting a loss in support activities\nfor mining (-11,000). Mining has lost 127,000 jobs since a recent peak in January 2019,\nalthough nearly three-fourths of this decline has occurred since February 2020.\n\nIn July, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by\n7 cents to $29.39, following large changes in recent months. Average hourly earnings of\nprivate-sector production and nonsupervisory employees decreased by 11 cents to $24.63\nin July. The large employment fluctuations--especially in lower-paid industries--over the\npast several months complicate the analysis of recent trends in average hourly earnings.\n(See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased by 0.1 hour\nto 34.5 hours in July. In manufacturing, the workweek rose by 0.7 hour to 39.7 hours,\nand overtime increased by 0.3 hour to 2.8 hours. The average workweek for production and\nnonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.0 hours. (See\ntables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for May was revised up by 26,000, from\n+2,699,000 to +2,725,000, and the change for June was revised down by 9,000, from\n+4,800,000 to +4,791,000. With these revisions, employment in May and June combined\nwas 17,000 higher than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional\nreports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published\nestimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.) \n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for August is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, September 4, 2020, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n __________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   |\n|        Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on July 2020 Establishment \t\t   |\n|                       and Household Survey Data\t\t\t\t   |\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   |\n| Data collection for both surveys was affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19)\t   |\n| pandemic.

Although\nunemployment fell in May and June, the jobless rate and the number of unemployed are up\nby 7.6 percentage points and 12.0 million, respectively, since February. (See table A-1.\nFor more information about how the household survey and its measures were affected by\nthe coronavirus pandemic, see the box note at the end of the news release.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates declined in June for adult men \n(10.2 percent), adult women (11.2 percent), teenagers (23.2 percent), Whites (10.1 \npercent), Blacks (15.4 percent), and Hispanics (14.5 percent). The jobless rate for \nAsians (13.8 percent) changed little over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of unemployed persons who were on temporary layoff decreased by 4.8 million\nin June to 10.6 million, following a decline of 2.7 million in May. The number of\npermanent job losers continued to rise, increasing by 588,000 to 2.9 million in June. \nThe number of unemployed reentrants to the labor force rose by 711,000 to 2.4 million.\n(Reentrants are persons who previously worked but were not in the labor force prior to\nbeginning their job search.) (See table A-11.)\n\nThe number of unemployed persons who were jobless less than 5 weeks declined by 1.0\nmillion to 2.8 million in June. Unemployed persons who were jobless 5 to 14 weeks \nnumbered 11.5 million, down by 3.3 million over the month, and accounted for 65.2 \npercent of the unemployed. By contrast, the number of persons jobless 15 to 26 weeks \nand the long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) saw over-the-month \nincreases (+825,000 to 1.9 million and +227,000 to 1.4 million, respectively). (See \ntable A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate increased by 0.7 percentage point in June to 61.5\npercent, but is 1.9 percentage points below its February level. Total employment, as\nmeasured by the household survey, rose by 4.9 million to 142.2 million in June. The \nemployment-population ratio, at 54.6 percent, rose by 1.8 percentage points over the\nmonth but is 6.5 percentage points lower than in February.

Over the month, \nemployment in food services and drinking places rose by 1.5 million, following a gain\nof the same magnitude in May. Despite these gains, employment in food services and\ndrinking places is down by 3.1 million since February. Employment also rose in June\nin amusements, gambling, and recreation (+353,000) and in the accommodation industry \n(+239,000). \n\nIn June, employment in retail trade rose by 740,000, after a gain of 372,000 in May\nand losses totaling 2.4 million in March and April combined. On net, employment in the\nindustry is 1.3 million lower than in February.

Health care employment increased by 358,000 over the\nmonth, with gains in offices of dentists (+190,000), offices of physicians (+80,000),\nand offices of other health practitioners (+48,000). Elsewhere in health care, job \nlosses continued in nursing care facilities (-18,000).

Employment in private \neducation rose by 93,000 over the month. \n\nEmployment increased in the other services industry in June (+357,000), with about \nthree-fourths of the increase occurring in personal and laundry services (+264,000). \nSince February, employment in the other services industry is down by 752,000.\n\nIn June, manufacturing employment rose by 356,000 but is down by 757,000 since \nFebruary. June employment increases were concentrated in the durable goods component,\nwith motor vehicles and parts (+196,000) accounting for over half of the job gain in\nmanufacturing. Employment also increased over the month in miscellaneous durable \ngoods manufacturing (+26,000) and machinery (+18,000). Within the nondurable goods\ncomponent, the largest job gain occurred in plastics and rubber products (+22,000). \n\nProfessional and business services added 306,000 jobs in June, but employment is 1.8\nmillion below its February level. In June, employment rose in temporary help services\n(+149,000), services to buildings and dwellings (+53,000), and accounting and \nbookkeeping services (+18,000). By contrast, employment declined in computer systems\ndesign and related services (-20,000).\n\nConstruction employment increased by 158,000 in June, following a gain of 453,000 in\nMay. These gains accounted for more than half of the decline in March and April \n(-1.1 million combined). Over-the-month gains occurred in specialty trade contractors\n(+135,000), with growth about equally split between the residential and nonresidential\ncomponents. Job gains also occurred in construction of buildings (+32,000). \n\nTransportation and warehousing added 99,000 jobs in June, following declines in the\nprior 2 months (-588,000 in April and May combined). In June, employment rose in \nwarehousing and storage (+61,000), couriers and messengers (+21,000), truck \ntransportation (+8,000), and support activities for transportation (+7,000). \n\nWholesale trade employment rose by 68,000 in June but is down by 317,000 since \nFebruary. In June, job gains occurred in the durable goods (+39,000) and nondurable \ngoods (+27,000) components.  \n\nFinancial activities added 32,000 jobs in June, with over half of the gain in real\nestate (+18,000). Since February, employment in financial activities is down by \n237,000.\n\nGovernment employment changed little in June (+33,000), as job gains in local \ngovernment education (+70,000) were partially offset by job losses in state government \n(-25,000). Government employment is 1.5 million below its February level. \n\nMining continued to lose jobs in June (-10,000), with most of the decline occurring in\nsupport activities for mining (-7,000). Mining employment is down by 123,000 since a \nrecent peak in January 2019, although nearly three-fourths of the decline has occurred\nsince February 2020.\n\nIn June, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls fell by\n35 cents to $29.37. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and \nnonsupervisory employees decreased by 23 cents to $24.74 in June. The decreases in\naverage hourly earnings largely reflect job gains among lower-paid workers; these \nchanges put downward pressure on the average hourly earnings estimates. (See tables \nB-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased by 0.2 \nhour to 34.5 hours in June. In manufacturing, the workweek rose by 0.5 hour to 39.2 \nhours, and overtime was unchanged at 2.4 hours. The average workweek for production \nand nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls fell by 0.2 hour to 33.9 \nhours. The recent employment changes, especially in industries with shorter workweeks,\ncomplicate monthly comparisons of the average weekly hours estimates. (See tables B-2\nand B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for April was revised down by 100,000,\nfrom -20.7 million to -20.8 million, and the change for May was revised up by 190,000,\nfrom +2.5 million to +2.7 million. With these revisions, employment in April and May\ncombined was 90,000 higher than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from \nadditional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last\npublished estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.) \n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for July is scheduled to be released on Friday, August 7,\n2020, at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n\n  _______________________________________________________________________________________\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n |   Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on June 2020 Establishment and Household Survey Data  |\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n | Data collection for both surveys was affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. |\n | In the establishment survey, approximately one-fifth of the data is assigned to four  |\n | regional data collection centers.

The household survey is generally collected through in-person and telephone |\n | interviews, but personal interviews were not conducted for the safety of interviewers |\n | and respondents. The household survey response rate, at 65 percent, was about 18      |\n | percentage points lower than in months prior to the pandemic.                         |\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n | In the establishment survey, workers who are paid by their employer for all or any    |\n | part of the pay period including the 12th of the month are counted as employed, even  |\n | if they were not actually at their jobs.

Workers who |\n | indicate they were not working during the entire survey reference week and expect to  |\n | be recalled to their jobs should be classified as unemployed on temporary layoff. In  |\n | June, a large number of persons were classified as unemployed on temporary layoff.    |\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n | As was the case in March, April, and May, household survey interviewers were          |\n | instructed to classify employed persons absent from work due to temporary,            |\n | coronavirus-related business closures as unemployed on temporary layoff. BLS and      |\n | Census Bureau analyses of the underlying data suggest that this group still included  |\n | some workers affected by the pandemic who should have been classified as unemployed   |\n | on temporary layoff. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n | The degree of misclassification declined considerably in June. BLS and Census Bureau  |\n | staff have been reviewing survey responses that might have been misclassified. The    |\n | misclassification hinges on a question about the main reason people were absent from  |\n | their jobs. If people who were absent due to temporary, pandemic-related closures     |\n | were recorded as absent due to \"other reasons,\" they could have been misclassified.   |\n | When interviewers record a response of \"other reason,\" they also add a few words      |\n | describing that other reason. The review of these brief descriptions found that the   |\n | share of responses that may have been misclassified was much smaller in June than in  |\n | prior months. BLS and the Census Bureau are continuing to investigate the             |\n | misclassification and are taking additional steps to address the issue.\t\t |\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n | If the workers who were recorded as employed but absent from work due to \"other       |\n | reasons\" (over and above the number absent for other reasons in a typical June) had   |\n | been classified as unemployed on temporary layoff, the overall unemployment rate      |\n | would have been about 1 percentage point higher than reported (on a not seasonally    |\n | adjusted basis). However, this represents the upper bound of our estimate of          |\n | misclassification and probably overstates the size of the misclassification error.    |\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n | According to usual practice, the data from the household survey are accepted as       |\n | recorded.

The corrections affected a limited number of data series \npresented in tables A-8, A-9, A-13, and A-14 of this release; for the vast majority\nof these series, the impact was negligible. Most major series, including the official\nunemployment rate, were not affected. Estimates in the BLS online database were \ncorrected for January\u2013July 2020. For more information on these corrections, see \nwww.bls.gov/bls/errata/revision-to-current-population-survey-estimates-for-January-\nthrough-July-2020.htm.)\n\n\n\t\t\t  THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION -- MAY 2020\n\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 2.5 million in May, and the unemployment rate \ndeclined to 13.3 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. These\nimprovements in the labor market reflected a limited resumption of economic activity\nthat had been curtailed in March and April due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic\nand efforts to contain it. In May, employment rose sharply in leisure and hospitality,\nconstruction, education and health services, and retail trade. By contrast, employment\nin government continued to decline sharply.\n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey\nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics.\nThe establishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry.\nFor more information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two\nsurveys, see the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate declined by 1.4 percentage points to 13.3 percent in May, and\nthe number of unemployed persons fell by 2.1 million to 21.0 million. Reflecting the\neffects of the coronavirus pandemic and efforts to contain it, the unemployment rate\nand the number of unemployed persons are up by 9.8 percentage points and 15.2 million,\nrespectively, since February. (See table A-1. For more information about how the\nhousehold survey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic, see the\nbox note at the end of the news release.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates declined in May for adult men\n(11.6 percent), adult women (13.9 percent), Whites (12.4 percent), and Hispanics (17.6\npercent). The jobless rates for teenagers (29.9 percent), Blacks (16.8 percent), and\nAsians (15.0 percent) showed little change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, \nand A-3.)\n\nThe number of unemployed persons who were on temporary layoff decreased by 2.7 million\nin May to 15.3 million, following a sharp increase of 16.2 million in April. Among \nthose not on temporary layoff, the number of permanent job losers continued to rise,\nincreasing by 295,000 in May to 2.3 million. (See table A-11.)\n\nIn May, the number of unemployed persons who were jobless less than 5 weeks decreased\nby 10.4 million to 3.9 million. These individuals made up 18.5 percent of the\nunemployed. The number of unemployed persons who were jobless 5 to 14 weeks rose by\n7.8 million to 14.8 million, accounting for about 70.8 percent of the unemployed. The\nnumber of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more), at 1.2 million,\nincreased by 225,000 over the month and represented 5.6 percent of the unemployed. \n(See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate increased by 0.6 percentage point in May to 60.8\npercent, following a decrease of 2.5 percentage points in April. Total employment,\nas measured by the household survey, rose by 3.8 million in May to 137.2 million, \nfollowing a large decline in April. After an 8.7 percentage-point decline in April,\nthe employment-population ratio rose by 1.5 percentage points to 52.8 percent in\nMay. (See table A-1.)\n\nIn May, the number of persons who usually work full time increased by 2.2 million\nto 116.5 million, and the number who usually work part time rose by 1.6 million to\n20.7 million. Part-time workers accounted for about two-fifths of the over-the-month\nemployment growth. (See table A-9.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 10.6 million, \nchanged little in May, but is up by 6.3 million since February. These individuals,\nwho would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their\nhours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. This group \nincludes persons who usually work full time and persons who usually work part time.\n(See table A-8.)\n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job, at 9.0 \nmillion, declined by 954,000 in May, after increasing by 4.4 million in April. These\nindividuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking \nfor work during the last 4 weeks or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nPersons marginally attached to the labor force--a subset of persons not in the labor\nforce who currently want a job--numbered 2.4 million in May, little different from \nthe prior month. These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were \navailable for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had\nnot looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. Discouraged workers, a \nsubset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them,\nnumbered 662,000 in May, also little changed from the previous month. (See Summary \ntable A.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 2.5 million in May, reflecting a \nlimited resumption of economic activity that had been curtailed due to the coronavirus\npandemic and efforts to contain it. Employment fell by 1.4 million and 20.7 million,\nrespectively, in March and April. Despite the over-the-month increase, nonfarm \nemployment in May was 13 percent below its February level. Large employment increases\noccurred in May in leisure and hospitality, construction, education and health services,\nand retail trade. Government employment continued to decline sharply. (See table B-1.\nFor more information about how the establishment survey and its measures were affected\nby the coronavirus pandemic, see the box note at the end of the news release.) \n\nIn May, employment in leisure and hospitality increased by 1.2 million, following losses\nof 7.5 million in April and 743,000 in March. Over the month, employment in food \nservices and drinking places rose by 1.4 million, accounting for about half of the gain\nin total nonfarm employment. May's gain in food services and drinking places followed\nsteep declines in April and March (-6.1 million combined). In contrast, employment in\nthe accommodation industry fell in May (-148,000) and has declined by 1.1 million since\nFebruary.\n\nConstruction employment increased by 464,000 in May, gaining back almost half of \nApril's decline (-995,000). Much of the gain occurred in specialty trade contractors\n(+325,000), with growth about equally split between the residential and nonresidential\ncomponents. Job gains also occurred in construction of buildings (+105,000), largely in\nresidential building. \n\nEmployment increased by 424,000 in education and health services in May, after a \ndecrease of 2.6 million in April. Health care employment increased by 312,000 over the\nmonth, with gains in offices of dentists (+245,000), offices of other health \npractitioners (+73,000), and offices of physicians (+51,000). Elsewhere in health care,\njob losses continued in nursing and residential care facilities (-37,000) and hospitals\n(-27,000). Employment increased in the social assistance industry (+78,000), reflecting\nincreases in child day care services (+44,000) and individual and family services \n(+29,000). Employment in private education rose by 33,000 over the month. \n\nIn May, employment in retail trade rose by 368,000, after a loss of 2.3 million in\nApril. Over-the-month job gains occurred in clothing and clothing accessories stores \n(+95,000), automobile dealers (+85,000), and general merchandise stores (+84,000). By\ncontrast, job losses continued in electronics and appliance stores (-95,000) and in \nauto parts, accessories, and tire stores (-36,000). \n\nEmployment increased in the other services industry in May (+272,000), following a \ndecline of 1.3 million in April. About two-thirds of the May increase occurred in \npersonal and laundry services (+182,000).\n\nIn May, manufacturing employment rose by 225,000, with gains about evenly split between\nthe durable and nondurable goods components. In April, manufacturing employment\ndeclined by 1.3 million, with about two-thirds of the loss occurring in the durable \ngoods component. Within durable goods, employment gains in May were led by motor\nvehicles and parts (+28,000), fabricated metal products (+25,000), and machinery \n(+23,000). Within nondurable goods, job gains occurred in plastics and rubber products\n(+30,000) and food manufacturing (+25,000).\n\nProfessional and business services added 127,000 jobs in May, after shedding 2.2 million\njobs in April. Over the month, employment rose in services to buildings and dwellings\n(+68,000) and temporary help services (+39,000), while employment declined in management\nof companies and enterprises (-22,000). \n\nFinancial activities added 33,000 jobs over the month, following a loss of 264,000 jobs\nin April. In May, employment gains occurred in real estate and rental and leasing\n(+24,000) and in credit intermediation and related activities (+7,000).\n\nWholesale trade employment was up by 21,000 in May, largely reflecting job gains in its\nnondurable goods component (+13,000). In April, wholesale trade employment declined by\n383,000.\n\nIn May, employment continued to decline in government (-585,000), following a drop of \n963,000 in April. Employment in local government was down by 487,000 in May. Local \ngovernment education accounted for almost two-thirds of the decrease (-310,000), \nreflecting school closures. Employment also continued to decline in state government \n(-84,000), particularly in state education (-63,000).\n\nEmployment in information fell by 38,000 in May, following a decline of 272,000 in April.\n\nMining continued to lose jobs in May (-20,000), with most of the decline occurring in\nsupport activities for mining (-16,000). Mining employment has declined by 77,000 over \nthe past 3 months.\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing decreased in May (-19,000), after an April\ndecline of 553,000. Air transportation lost 50,000 jobs over the month, following a \nloss of 79,000 jobs in April. In May, employment rose by 12,000 in couriers and \nmessengers and 10,000 in transit and ground passenger transportation.\n\nIn May, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls fell by\n29 cents to $29.75, following a gain of $1.35 in April. Average hourly earnings of \nprivate-sector production and nonsupervisory employees decreased by 14 cents to $25.00\nin May. The decreases in average hourly earnings largely reflect job gains among lower-\npaid workers; this change put downward pressure on the average hourly earnings estimates.\n(See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.5 hour\nto 34.7 hours in May. In manufacturing, the workweek rose by 0.8 hour to 38.9 hours, and\novertime increased by 0.3 hour to 2.4 hours. The average workweek for production and \nnonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.6 hour to 34.1 hours.\nWhile employees in most industries saw an increase in their workweeks in May, the \nemployment changes, especially in industries with shorter workweeks, complicate monthly\ncomparisons of the average weekly hours estimates. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for March was revised down by 492,000,\nfrom -881,000 to -1.4 million, and the change for April was revised down by 150,000,\nfrom -20.5 million to -20.7 million. With these revisions, employment in March and \nApril  combined was 642,000 lower than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result\nfrom additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last \npublished estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors. A methodological\nchange to the establishment survey's birth-death model contributed to the revision for\nMarch. For more information, see the box note at the end of the news release.) After \nrevisions, job losses have averaged 6.5 million per month over the past 3 months. \n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for June is scheduled to be released on Thursday, July 2, 2020,\nat 8:30 a.m. (EDT).\n\n\n  _______________________________________________________________________________________\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n |   Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on May 2020 Establishment and Household Survey Data   |\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n | Data collection for both surveys was affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. |\n | In the establishment survey, approximately one-fifth of the data is collected at four |\n | regional data collection centers. Although these centers were closed, about three-    |\n | quarters of the interviewers at these centers worked remotely to collect data by      |\n | telephone. Additionally, BLS encouraged businesses to report electronically. The      |\n | collection rate for the establishment survey in May was 69 percent, slightly lower    |\n | than collection rates prior to the pandemic. The household survey is generally        |\n | collected through in-person and telephone interviews, but personal interviews were    |\n | not conducted for the safety of interviewers and respondents. The household survey    |\n | response rate, at 67 percent, was about 15 percentage points lower than in months     |\n | prior to the pandemic. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n | In the establishment survey, workers who are paid by their employer for all or any    |\n | part of the pay period including the 12th of the month are counted as employed, even  |\n | if they were not actually at their jobs.

Workers who  |\n | indicate they were not working during the entire survey reference week and expect to  |\n | be recalled to their jobs should be classified as unemployed on temporary layoff. In  |\n | May, a large number of persons were classified as unemployed on temporary layoff.     |\n |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n | However, there was also a large number of workers who were classified as employed but |\n | absent from work.

The corrections \naffected a limited number of data series presented in tables A-8, A-9, A-13, and A-14 of this release;\nfor the vast majority of these series, the impact was negligible. Most major series, including the \nofficial unemployment rate, were not affected. Estimates in the BLS online database were corrected for\nJanuary\u2013July 2020. For more information on these corrections, see \nwww.bls.gov/bls/errata/revision-to-current-population-survey-estimates-for-January-through-July-2020.htm.)\n\n(NOTE: On May 11, 2020, BLS corrected errors in national estimates for seasonally adjusted all employees\nin professional and technical services, professional and business services, private service-providing,\nservice-providing, total private, and total nonfarm. Tables affected are Summary table B, B-1, B-4, and\nB-5. The corrected change in total nonfarm employment for April is 37,000 lower than initially reported.\nEstimates in the LABSTAT database and in this news release were corrected for February, March, and April\n2020. BLS also corrected other supporting documentation on www.bls.gov/ces/.)\n\n\n                 \t\tTHE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION -- APRIL 2020     \n\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment fell by 20.5 million in April, and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent,\nthe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. The changes in these measures reflect the effects of the\ncoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and efforts to contain it. Employment fell sharply in all major industry sectors,\nwith particularly heavy job losses in leisure and hospitality.\n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey measures labor force status,\nincluding unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The establishment survey measures nonfarm employment,\nhours, and earnings by industry. For more information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these\ntwo surveys, see the Technical Note. \n\nHousehold Survey Data \n\nIn April, the unemployment rate increased by 10.3 percentage points to 14.7 percent. This is the highest rate and \nthe largest over-the-month increase in the history of the series (seasonally adjusted data are available back to \nJanuary 1948). The number of unemployed persons rose by 15.9 million to 23.1 million in April. The sharp increases \nin these measures reflect the effects of the coronavirus pandemic and efforts to contain it. (See table A-1. For more\ninformation about how the household survey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic, see the box \nat the end of the news release.) \n\nIn April, unemployment rates rose sharply among all major worker groups. The rate was 13.0 percent for adult men,\n15.5 percent for adult women, 31.9 percent for teenagers, 14.2 percent for Whites, 16.7 percent for Blacks, 14.5 \npercent for Asians, and 18.9 percent for Hispanics. The rates for all of these groups, with the exception of Blacks,\nrepresent record highs for their respective series. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.) \n\nThe number of unemployed persons who reported being on temporary layoff increased about ten-fold to 18.1 million in\nApril. The number of permanent job losers increased by 544,000 to 2.0 million. (See table A-11.) \n\nIn April, the number of unemployed persons who were jobless less than 5 weeks increased by 10.7 million to \n14.3 million, accounting for almost two-thirds of the unemployed. The number of unemployed persons who were \njobless 5 to 14 weeks rose by 5.2 million to 7.0 million. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless \nfor 27 weeks or more), at 939,000, declined by 225,000 over the month and represented 4.1 percent of the unemployed.\n(See table A-12.) \n\nThe labor force participation rate decreased by 2.5 percentage points over the month to 60.2 percent, the lowest\nrate since January 1973 (when it was 60.0 percent). Total employment, as measured by the household survey, fell\nby 22.4 million to 133.4 million. The employment-population ratio, at 51.3 percent, dropped by 8.7 percentage points\nover the month. This is the lowest rate and largest over-the-month decline in the history of the series (seasonally\nadjusted data are available back to January 1948). (See table A-1.) \n\nThe number of persons who usually work full time declined by 15.0 million over the month, and the number who usually\nwork part time declined by 7.4 million. Part-time workers accounted for one-third of the over-the-month employment \ndecline. (See table A-9.)\n\nThe number of persons at work part time for economic reasons nearly doubled over the month to 10.9 million. These \nindividuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been\nreduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. This group includes persons who usually work full time and \npersons who usually work part time. (See table A-8.) \n\nThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job, at 9.9 million, nearly doubled in April.\nThese individuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work during the last\n4 weeks or were unavailable to take a job. (See table A-1.)\n\nPersons marginally attached to the labor force--a subset of persons not in the labor force who currently want a \njob--numbered 2.3 million in April, up by 855,000 over the month. These individuals were not in the labor force,\nwanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not looked\nfor work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. Discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed\nthat no jobs were available for them, numbered 574,000 in April, little changed from the previous month.\n(See Summary table A.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment fell by 20.5 million in April, after declining by 881,000 in March. The April\nover-the-month decline is the largest in the history of the series and brought employment to its lowest level\nsince January 2011 (the series dates back to 1939). Job losses in April were widespread, with the largest \nemployment decline occurring in leisure and hospitality. (See table B-1. For more information about how the \nestablishment survey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus, see the box note at the end of the news\nrelease.)\n\nIn April, employment in leisure and hospitality plummeted by 7.7 million, or 47 percent. Almost three-quarters of the\ndecrease occurred in food services and drinking places (-5.5 million). Employment also fell in the arts, entertainment,\nand recreation industry (-1.3 million) and in the accommodation industry (-839,000).\n\nEmployment declined by 2.5 million in education and health services in April. In health care, employment declined by\n1.4 million, led by losses in offices of dentists (-503,000), offices of physicians (-243,000), and offices of other\nhealth care practitioners (-205,000). Employment also declined in social assistance (-651,000), reflecting job losses\nin child day care services (-336,000) and individual and family services (-241,000). Employment in private education\ndeclined by 457,000 over the month. \n\nProfessional and business services shed 2.2 million jobs in April. Sharp losses occurred in temporary help services\n(-842,000) and in services to buildings and dwellings (-259,000). \n\nIn April, employment in retail trade declined by 2.1 million. Job losses occurred in clothing and clothing accessories\nstores (-740,000), motor vehicle and parts dealers (-345,000), miscellaneous store retailers (-264,000), and furniture\nand home furnishings stores (-209,000). By contrast, the component of general merchandise stores that includes warehouse\nclubs and supercenters gained 93,000 jobs.  \n\nIn April, manufacturing employment dropped by 1.3 million. About two-thirds of the decline was in durable goods\nmanufacturing (-914,000), which saw losses in motor vehicles and parts (-382,000) and in fabricated metal products\n(-109,000). Nondurable goods manufacturing shed 416,000 jobs.\n\nEmployment in the other services industry declined by 1.3 million in April, with nearly two-thirds of the decline \noccurring in personal and laundry services (-797,000).\n\nGovernment employment dropped by 980,000 in April. Employment in local government was down by 801,000, in part reflecting\nschool closures. Employment also declined in state government education (-176,000).\n\nConstruction employment fell by 975,000 in April, with much of the loss in specialty trade contractors (-691,000). Job\nlosses also occurred in construction of buildings (-206,000). \n\nEmployment fell in transportation and warehousing in April (-584,000). Transit and ground passenger transportation and\nair transportation lost 185,000 jobs and 141,000 jobs, respectively.\n\nWholesale trade shed 363,000 jobs in April, largely reflecting losses in the durable and nondurable goods components. \n\nEmployment in financial activities fell by 262,000 over the month, with the vast majority of the decline occurring in \nreal estate and rental and leasing (-222,000). \n\nEmployment in information fell by 254,000 in April, driven by a decline in motion picture and sound recording \nindustries (-217,000).\n\nMining lost 46,000 jobs in April, with most of the decline occurring in support activities for mining (-33,000). \n\nIn April, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by $1.34 to $30.01. Average\nhourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees increased by $1.04 to $25.12 in April. The \nincreases in average hourly earnings largely reflect the substantial job loss among lower-paid workers; this change,\nalong with earnings increases, put upward pressure on the average hourly earnings estimates. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.1 hour to 34.2 hours in April. In\nmanufacturing, the workweek declined by 2.1 hours to 38.3 hours, and overtime declined by 0.9 hour to 2.1 hours. The\naverage workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.1 hour to\n33.5 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for February was revised down by 24,000 from +275,000 to +251,000, and\nthe change for March was revised down by 180,000 from -701,000 to -881,000. With these revisions, employment changes\nin February and March combined were 204,000 lower than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional\nreports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the \nrecalculation of seasonal factors.)\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for May is scheduled to be released on Friday, June 5, 2020, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).\n\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|      Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on April 2020 Establishment and Household Survey Data\t\t|\n| \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|  Data collection for both surveys was affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The household\t|\n|  survey is generally collected through in-person and telephone interviews, but personal interviews\t|\n|  were not conducted for the safety of interviewers and respondents. The household survey response\t|\n|  rate, at 70 percent, was about 13 percentage points lower than in months prior to the pandemic.\t|\n|  In the establishment survey, approximately one-fifth of the data is collected at four regional data\t|\n|  collection centers. Although these centers were closed, about half of the interviewers at these\t|\n|  centers worked remotely to collect data by telephone. Additionally, BLS encouraged businesses to\t|\n|  report electronically. The collection rate for the establishment survey in April was 74.9 percent,\t|\n|  essentially unchanged from collection rates prior to the pandemic.\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|  In the establishment survey, workers who are paid by their employer for all or any part of the pay\t|\n|  period including the 12th of the month are counted as employed, even if they were not actually at\t|\n|  their jobs. Workers who are temporarily or permanently absent from their jobs and are not being\t|\n|  paid are not counted as employed, even if they are continuing to receive benefits. The length of\t|\n|  the reference period does vary across the respondents in the establishment survey; one-third of\t|\n|  businesses have a weekly pay period, slightly over 40 percent a bi-weekly, about 20 percent \t\t|\n|  semi-monthly, and a small amount monthly. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|  There was a change to the estimation method used in the establishment survey for April. Business \t|\n|  births and deaths cannot be adequately captured by the establishment survey as they occur. Therefore,|\n|  the establishment survey estimates use a model to account for the relatively stable net employment\t|\n|  change generated by business births and deaths. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the \t|\n|  relationship between the two was no longer stable in April. Therefore, the establishment survey \t|\n|  made modifications to the birth-death model. For more information, see\t\t\t\t|\n|  www.bls.gov/cps/employment-situation-covid19-faq-april-2020.pdf. \t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|  In the household survey, individuals are classified as employed, unemployed, or not in the labor\t|\n|  force based on their answers to a series of questions about their activities during the survey \t|\n|  reference week (April 12th through April 18th). Workers who indicate they were not working during\t|\n|  the entire survey reference week and expect to be recalled to their jobs should be classified as \t|\n|  unemployed on temporary layoff.

As was the case in March, special instructions sent to household survey\t|\n|  interviewers called for all employed persons absent from work due to coronavirus-related business\t|\n|  closures to be classified as unemployed on temporary layoff.

The household\nsurvey measures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic \ncharacteristics. The establishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours,\nand earnings by industry. Note that the March survey reference periods for both\nsurveys predated many coronavirus-related business and school closures that \noccurred in the second half of the month. For more information about the concepts\nand statistical methodology used in these two surveys, see the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn March, the unemployment rate increased by 0.9 percentage point to 4.4 percent.\nThis is the largest over-the-month increase in the rate since January 1975, when\nthe increase was also 0.9 percentage point. The number of unemployed persons rose\nby 1.4 million to 7.1 million in March. The sharp increases in these measures\nreflect the effects of the coronavirus and efforts to contain it. (See table A-1.\nMeasures from the household survey pertain to the week of March 8th to March 14th.\nFor more information about how the household survey and its measures were affected\nby the coronavirus, see the box note at the end of this news release.)\n\nIn March, unemployment rates rose among all major worker groups. The rate was 4.0\npercent for adult men, 4.0 percent for adult women, 14.3 percent for teenagers,\n4.0 percent for Whites, 6.7 percent for Blacks, 4.1 percent for Asians, and 6.0\npercent for Hispanics. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of unemployed persons who reported being on temporary layoff more than\ndoubled in March to 1.8 million. The number of permanent job losers increased by\n177,000 to 1.5 million. (See table A-11.)\n\nThe number of unemployed persons who were jobless less than 5 weeks increased by\n1.5 million in March to 3.5 million, accounting for almost half of the unemployed.\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more), at 1.2\nmillion, was little changed in March and represented 15.9 percent of the unemployed.\n(See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate, at 62.7 percent, decreased by 0.7 percentage\npoint over the month. Total employment, as measured by the household survey, fell\nby 3.0 million to 155.8 million, and the employment-population ratio, at 60.0\npercent, dropped by 1.1 percentage points over the month. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 5.8 million,\nincreased by 1.4 million in March. These individuals, who would have preferred\nfull-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been reduced\nor they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn March, 1.4 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, little\nchanged from the previous month. These individuals were not in the labor force,\nwanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior\n12 months but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. Discouraged\nworkers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available\nfor them, numbered 514,000 in March, up by 109,000 from the previous month. (See\nSummary table A.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment fell sharply in March (-701,000), reflecting the\neffects of the coronavirus and efforts to contain it. About two-thirds of the drop\noccurred in leisure and hospitality, mainly in food services and drinking places.\nNotable employment declines also occurred in health care and social assistance,\nprofessional and business services, retail trade, and construction. In the prior\n12 months, nonfarm employment growth had averaged 196,000 per month. (See table\nB-1. Measures from the establishment survey pertain to the pay period including\nMarch 12th; pay periods may be weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly. For\nmore information about the establishment survey reference period and how survey\noperations were affected by the coronavirus, see the box note at the end of this\nnews release.)\n\nIn March, employment in leisure and hospitality fell by 459,000. Most of the\ndecline occurred in food services and drinking places (-417,000); this employment\ndecline nearly offset gains over the previous 2 years. Employment in the\naccommodation industry also declined in March (-29,000). \n\nEmployment in health care and social assistance fell by 61,000 in March. Health\ncare employment declined by 43,000, with job losses in offices of dentists\n(-17,000), offices of physicians (-12,000), and offices of other health care\npractitioners (-7,000). Over the prior 12 months, health care employment had\ngrown by 374,000. In March, social assistance saw an employment decline of 19,000,\nreflecting a job loss in child day care services (-19,000). Over the prior 12\nmonths, social assistance added 193,000 jobs.\n\nEmployment in professional and business services decreased by 52,000 in March,\nwith the decline concentrated in temporary help services (-50,000). Employment\nalso decreased in travel arrangement and reservation services (-7,000).\n\nIn March, employment in retail trade declined by 46,000. Job losses occurred\nin clothing and clothing accessories stores (-16,000); furniture stores (-10,000);\nand sporting goods, hobby, book, and music stores (-9,000). General merchandise\nstores gained 10,000 jobs. \n\nEmployment decreased over the month in construction (-29,000). In March,\nnonresidential building (-11,000) and heavy and civil engineering construction\n(-10,000) lost jobs. Construction employment had increased by 211,000 over\nthe prior 12 months.\n\nEmployment in the other services industry declined by 24,000 in March, with\nabout half of the loss occurring in personal and laundry services (-13,000).\nOver the prior 12 months, other services had added 89,000 jobs.\n\nMining lost 6,000 jobs in March, with much of the decline occurring in support\nactivities for mining (-5,000). Since a recent peak in January 2019, mining\nemployment has declined by 42,000.\n\nIn March, manufacturing employment edged down (-18,000). Over the past 12 months,\nemployment in the industry has shown little net change.\n\nFederal government employment rose by 18,000 in March, reflecting the hiring of\n17,000 workers for the 2020 Census.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including wholesale trade, transportation\nand warehousing, information, and financial activities, changed little over the\nmonth.\n\nIn March, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls\nincreased by 11 cents to $28.62. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings\nhave increased by 3.1 percent. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production\nand nonsupervisory employees increased by 10 cents to $24.07 in March. (See tables\nB-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls fell by 0.2\nhour to 34.2 hours in March. The decline in the average workweek was most\npronounced in leisure and hospitality, where average weekly hours dropped by\n1.4 hours. In manufacturing, the workweek declined by 0.3 hour to 40.4 hours,\nand overtime declined by 0.2 hour to 3.0 hours. The average workweek for production\nand nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased by 0.3 hour\nto 33.4 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for January was revised down by\n59,000 from +273,000 to +214,000, and the change for February was revised up\nby 2,000 from +273,000 to +275,000. With these revisions, employment gains in\nJanuary and February combined were 57,000 lower than previously reported.\n(Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses and\ngovernment agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation\nof seasonal factors.) After revisions, job gains averaged 245,000 per month for\nJanuary and February. \n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for April is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, May 8, 2020, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).\n\n\n ________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n|               Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact on March 2020 \t\t         |\n|                 Establishment and Household Survey Data\t\t\t |\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n| March data from the establishment and household surveys broadly reflect\t |\n| some of the early effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the\t |\n| labor market.

However, it is clear that the decrease in employment\t |\n| and hours and the increase in unemployment can be ascribed to effects of the\t |\n| illness and efforts to contain the virus. It is important to keep in mind\t |\n| that the March survey reference periods for both surveys predated many\t |\n| coronavirus-related business and school closures in the second half of the\t |\n| month.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n| In the household survey, individuals are classified as employed, unemployed,\t |\n| or not in the labor force based on their answers to a series of questions\t |\n| about their activities during the survey reference week (March 8th through\t |\n| March 14th). Workers who indicate they were not working during the entire\t |\n| survey reference week and expect to be recalled to their jobs should be\t |\n| classified as unemployed on temporary layoff. In March 2020, there was an\t |\n| extremely large increase in the number of persons classified as unemployed\t |\n| on temporary layoff.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n| However, there was also a large increase in the number of workers who were\t |\n| classified as employed but absent from work. Special instructions sent to\t |\n| household survey interviewers just before data collection started for March\t |\n| called for all employed persons absent from work due to coronavirus-related\t |\n| business closures to be classified as unemployed on temporary layoff. \t |\n| However, it is apparent that not all such workers were so classified. Such\t |\n| a misclassification is an example of nonsampling error and can occur when\t |\n| respondents misunderstand questions or interviewers record answers \t\t |\n| incorrectly. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n| If the workers who were recorded as employed but absent from work due to\t |\n| \u201cother reasons\u201d (over and above the number absent for other reasons in a\t |\n| typical March) had been classified as unemployed on temporary layoff, the\t |\n| overall unemployment rate would have been almost 1 percentage point higher\t |\n| than reported. However, according to usual practice, the data from the\t |\n| household survey are accepted as recorded. To maintain data integrity, no\t |\n| ad hoc actions are taken to reclassify survey responses.\t\t\t |\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n| In the establishment survey, workers who are paid by their employer for all\t |\n| or any part of the pay period including the 12th of the month are counted \t |\n| as employed, even if they were not actually at their jobs. Workers who are\t |\n| temporarily or permanently absent from their jobs, but are not being paid,\t |\n| are not counted as employed, even if they are continuing to receive benefits.\t |\n| The length of the reference period does vary across the respondents in the\t |\n| establishment survey; one-third of respondents have a weekly pay period,\t |\n| slightly over 40 percent a bi-weekly, about 20 percent semi-monthly, and a\t |\n| small amount monthly. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n| Data collection for both surveys was affected by the coronavirus. The\t\t |\n| household survey is generally collected through in-person and telephone\t |\n| interviews, but personal interviews were suspended during the collection\t |\n| period for the safety of interviewers and respondents. The household survey\t |\n| response rate, at 73 percent, was about 10 percentage points lower than in\t |\n| recent months. In the establishment survey, about one-fifth of the data is\t |\n| generally collected by telephone at four regional data collection centers.\t |\n| Although these centers were closed during the collection period, efforts were\t |\n| made to collect data electronically. The collection rate for the establishment |\n| survey, at 66 percent, was about 9 percentage points lower than average.\t |\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n| More information is available at\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n| www.bls.gov/cps/employment-situation-covid19-faq-march-2020.pdf. \t\t |\n|________________________________________________________________________________|\n\n\n\n",

Notable job gains occurred in health care and social assistance,\nfood services and drinking places, government, construction, professional and\ntechnical services, and financial activities.\n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household\nsurvey measures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic\ncharacteristics. The establishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and\nearnings by industry. For more information about the concepts and statistical\nmethodology used in these two surveys, see the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nBoth the unemployment rate, at 3.5 percent, and the number of unemployed persons,\nat 5.8 million, changed little in February. The unemployment rate has been either\n3.5 percent or 3.6 percent for the past 6 months. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for Asians declined to 2.5\npercent in February. The rates for adult men (3.3 percent), adult women (3.1 percent),\nteenagers (11.0 percent), Whites (3.1 percent), Blacks (5.8 percent), and Hispanics\n(4.4 percent) showed little or no change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more), at 1.1\nmillion, changed little in February and accounted for 19.2 percent of the unemployed.\n(See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate remained at 63.4 percent in February. The\nemployment-population ratio, at 61.1 percent, changed little over the month but was\nup by 0.4 percentage point over the year. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 4.3 million,\nchanged little in February. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time\nemployment, were working part time because their hours had been reduced or they\nwere unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn February, 1.4 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force,\nlittle changed from the previous month. These individuals were not in the labor\nforce, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the\nprior 12 months but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks prior to the survey. \nDiscouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no\njobs were available for them, numbered 405,000 in February, little different\nfrom the previous month. (See Summary table A.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 273,000 in February, after an increase of\nthe same magnitude in January. In 2019, job growth averaged 178,000 per month. In\nFebruary, notable job gains occurred in health care and social assistance, food\nservices and drinking places, government, construction, professional and technical\nservices, and financial activities. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in health care and social assistance increased by 57,000 in February.\nHealth care added 32,000 jobs, with gains in offices of physicians (+10,000), home\nhealth care services (+10,000), and hospitals (+8,000). Employment in social assistance\nincreased by 25,000, with a majority of the gain in individual and family services\n(+18,000). Over the past 12 months, employment increased by 368,000 in health care and\nby 191,000 in social assistance. \n\nFood services and drinking places added 53,000 jobs in February. Employment in the\nindustry has increased by 252,000 over the past 7 months, following a lull in job growth\nearlier in 2019.\n\nIn February, government employment increased by 45,000, led by a gain in state government\neducation (+16,000). Federal employment increased by 8,000, reflecting the hiring of\n7,000 temporary workers for the 2020 Census. \n\nConstruction added 42,000 jobs in February, following a similar gain in January (+49,000).\nIn 2019, job gains averaged 13,000 per month. In February, employment gains occurred\nin specialty trade contractors (+26,000) and residential building (+10,000). \n\nIn February, employment in professional and technical services increased by 32,000. Job\ngrowth occurred in architectural and engineering services (+10,000) and in scientific\nresearch and development services (+5,000). Employment continued to trend up in computer\nsystems design and related services (+8,000). Over the past 12 months, professional and\ntechnical services has added 285,000 jobs. \n\nEmployment in financial activities increased by 26,000 in February, with gains in real\nestate (+8,000) and in credit intermediation and related activities (+6,000). Over the\npast 12 months, financial activities has added 160,000 jobs.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including mining, manufacturing, wholesale trade,\nretail trade, transportation and warehousing, and information, changed little over the\nmonth.\n\nIn February, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls\nincreased by 9 cents to $28.52. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have \nincreased by 3.0 percent. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and\nnonsupervisory employees increased by 8 cents to $23.96 in February. (See tables B-3\nand B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 0.1 hour to\n34.4 hours in February. In manufacturing, the workweek increased by 0.2 hour to 40.7\nhours, and overtime edged up by 0.1 hour to 3.2 hours. The average workweek for production\nand nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.1 hour to 33.7\nhours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for December was revised up by 37,000 from\n+147,000 to +184,000, and the change for January was revised up by 48,000 from +225,000\nto +273,000. With these revisions, employment gains in December and January combined were\n85,000 higher than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports\nreceived from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and\nfrom the recalculation of seasonal factors.) After revisions, job gains have averaged\n243,000 per month over the last 3 months.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for March is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, April 3, 2020, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).\n\n\n\n",

These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available\nfor work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted\nas unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey\nfor a variety of reasons, such as belief that no jobs are available for them (referred\nto as discouraged workers), school attendance, or family responsibilities.

For information\nabout the annual benchmark process, see the note at the end of the news release and table A.)\n\nIn January, construction employment rose by 44,000. Most of the gain occurred in specialty\ntrade contractors, with increases in both the residential (+18,000) and nonresidential\n(+17,000) components. Construction added an average of 12,000 jobs per month in 2019. \n\nHealth care added 36,000 jobs in January, with gains in ambulatory health care services\n(+23,000) and hospitals (+10,000). Health care has added 361,000 jobs over the past 12 months. \n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing increased by 28,000 in January.

The\nbenchmark process results in revisions to not seasonally adjusted data from April 2018\nforward. BLS revised seasonally adjusted data from January 2015 forward. In addition,\nboth seasonally adjusted and unadjusted data for some series incorporate other\nrevisions prior to 2015.  \n\nThe total nonfarm employment level for March 2019 was revised downward by 514,000\n(-505,000 on a not seasonally adjusted basis), or -0.3 percent. The absolute average\nbenchmark revision over the past 10 years is 0.2 percent. \n\nThe over-the-year change in total nonfarm employment for 2019 was revised from \n+2,108,000 to +2,096,000 (seasonally adjusted).

Population estimates for the household survey are developed by the\nU.S. Census Bureau. Each year, the Census Bureau updates the estimates to reflect new\ninformation and assumptions about the growth of the population since the previous decennial\ncensus. The change in population reflected in the new estimates results from adjustments\nfor net international migration, updated vital statistics, and estimation methodology\nimprovements. \n\nIn accordance with usual practice, BLS will not revise the official household survey estimates\nfor December 2019 and earlier months. To show the impact of the population adjustments,\nhowever, differences in selected December 2019 labor force series based on the old and new\npopulation estimates are shown in table B.\n\nThe adjustments decreased the estimated size of the civilian noninstitutional population in\nDecember by 811,000, the civilian labor force by 524,000, employment by 507,000, and\nunemployment by 17,000. The number of persons not in the labor force was decreased by 287,000.\nThe total unemployment rate, employment-population ratio, and labor force participation rate\nwere unaffected.\n\nData users are cautioned that these annual population adjustments can affect the comparability\nof household data series over time. Table C shows the effect of the introduction of new\npopulation estimates on the comparison of selected labor force measures between December 2019\nand January 2020. Additional information on the population adjustments and their effect on\nnational labor force estimates is available at\nwww.bls.gov/web/empsit/cps-pop-control-adjustments.pdf. \n\nPopulation controls for veterans, which are derived from a Department of Veterans Affairs' \npopulation model and are updated periodically, have also been updated with the release of\ndata for January 2020. Historical data have not been revised.\n\n\n\n    Table B.

Seasonally    |\n | adjusted estimates back to January 2015 were subject to revision. The unemployment   |\n | rates for January 2019 through November 2019 (as originally published and as revised)|\n | appear in table A, along with additional information about the revisions.            |\n |______________________________________________________________________________________|\n\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn December, the unemployment rate held at 3.5 percent, and the number of unemployed\npersons was unchanged at 5.8 million. A year earlier, the jobless rate was 3.9 percent,\nand the number of unemployed persons was 6.3 million. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.1 percent), adult\nwomen (3.2 percent), teenagers (12.6 percent), Whites (3.2 percent), Blacks (5.9 percent),\nAsians (2.5 percent), and Hispanics (4.2 percent) showed little or no change in December.\n(See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more), at 1.2 million,\nwas unchanged in December and accounted for 20.5 percent of the unemployed. (See table\nA-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate was unchanged at 63.2 percent in December. The\nemployment-population ratio was 61.0 percent for the fourth consecutive month but was\nup by 0.4 percentage point over the year. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 4.1 million, changed\nlittle in December but was down by 507,000 over the year. These individuals, who would\nhave preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been\nreduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn December, 1.2 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, down by\n310,000 from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were\nnot in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job \nsometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had\nnot searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 277,000 discouraged workers in December, down\nby 98,000 from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers\nare persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for\nthem. The remaining 969,000 persons marginally attached to the labor force in December\nhad not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.\n(See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 145,000 in December. Notable job gains\noccurred in retail trade and health care, while mining lost jobs. In 2019, payroll\nemployment rose by 2.1 million, down from a gain of 2.7 million in 2018. (See table B-1.)\n\nIn December, retail trade added 41,000 jobs. Employment increased in clothing and \naccessories stores (+33,000) and in building material and garden supply stores (+7,000);\nboth industries showed employment declines in the prior month. Employment in retail trade\nchanged little, on net, in both 2019 and 2018 (+9,000 and +14,000, respectively). \n\nEmployment in health care increased by 28,000 in December. Ambulatory health care services\nand hospitals added jobs over the month (+23,000 and +9,000, respectively). Health care\nadded 399,000 jobs in 2019, compared with an increase of 350,000 in 2018. \n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality continued to trend up in December (+40,000). The\nindustry added 388,000 jobs in 2019, similar to the increase in 2018 (+359,000). \n\nMining employment declined by 8,000 in December. In 2019, employment in mining declined\nby 24,000, after rising by 63,000 in 2018. \n\nConstruction employment changed little in December (+20,000). Employment in the industry\nrose by 151,000 in 2019, about half of the 2018 gain of 307,000. \n\nIn December, employment in professional and business services showed little change\n(+10,000). The industry added 397,000 jobs in 2019, down from an increase of 561,000\njobs in 2018.  \n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing changed little in December (-10,000).\nEmployment in the industry increased by 57,000 in 2019, about one-fourth of the 2018\ngain of 216,000. \n\nManufacturing employment was little changed in December (-12,000). Employment in the\nindustry changed little in 2019 (+46,000), after increasing in 2018 (+264,000). \n\nIn December, employment showed little change in other major industries, including wholesale\ntrade, information, financial activities, and government. \n\nIn December, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose\nby 3 cents to $28.32. Over the last 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by\n2.9 percent. In December, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and\nnonsupervisory employees, at $23.79, were little changed (+2 cents). (See tables B-3 and\nB-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.3\nhours in December. In manufacturing, the average workweek and overtime remained at 40.5\nhours and 3.2 hours, respectively. The average workweek of private-sector production and\nnonsupervisory employees held at 33.5 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for October was revised down by 4,000 from\n+156,000 to +152,000, and the change for November was revised down by 10,000 from +266,000\nto +256,000. With these revisions, employment gains in October and November combined were\n14,000 lower than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports\nreceived from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and\nfrom the recalculation of seasonal factors.) After revisions, job gains have averaged\n184,000 over the last 3 months. \n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for January is scheduled to be released on Friday, February 7,\n2020, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n ______________________________________________________________________________________\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       |\n|                   Upcoming Changes to Household Survey Data\t\t\t       |\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       |\n|  With the publication of The Employment Situation for January 2020 on February 7,    |\n|  2020, two not seasonally adjusted series currently displayed in Summary table       |\n|  A--persons marginally attached to the labor force and discouraged workers--will     |\n|  be replaced with new seasonally adjusted series.

The household survey\nmeasures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics.\nThe establishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry.\nFor more information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two\nsurveys, see the Technical Note.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nBoth the unemployment rate, at 3.5 percent, and the number of unemployed persons, at\n5.8 million, changed little in November. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.2 percent),\nadult women (3.2 percent), teenagers (12.0 percent), Whites (3.2 percent), Blacks\n(5.5 percent), Asians (2.6 percent), and Hispanics (4.2 percent) showed little or no\nchange in November. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more), at 1.2 million,\nwas essentially unchanged in November and accounted for 20.8 percent of the unemployed.\n(See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate was little changed at 63.2 percent in November. The\nemployment-population ratio was 61.0 percent for the third consecutive month. (See\ntable A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 4.3 million, changed\nlittle in November. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment,\nwere working part time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find\nfull-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn November, 1.2 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, down by\n432,000 from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were\nnot in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job\nsometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had\nnot searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 325,000 discouraged workers in November, down\nby 128,000 from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers\nare persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for\nthem. The remaining 921,000 persons marginally attached to the labor force in November\nhad not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.\n(See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 266,000 in November. Job growth has averaged\n180,000 per month thus far in 2019, compared with an average monthly gain of 223,000 in\n2018. In November, notable job gains occurred in health care and in professional and\ntechnical services. Employment also increased in manufacturing, reflecting the return\nof workers from a strike. Employment continued to trend up in leisure and hospitality,\ntransportation and warehousing, and financial activities, while mining lost jobs. (See\ntable B-1.)\n\nIn November, health care added 45,000 jobs, following little employment change in October\n(+12,000). The November job gains occurred in ambulatory health care services (+34,000)\nand in hospitals (+10,000). Health care has added 414,000 jobs over the last 12 months.\n\nEmployment in professional and technical services increased by 31,000 in November and by\n278,000 over the last 12 months. \n\nManufacturing employment rose by 54,000 in November, following a decline of 43,000 in the\nprior month. Within manufacturing, employment in motor vehicles and parts was up by 41,000\nin November, reflecting the return of workers who were on strike in October. \n\nIn November, employment in leisure and hospitality continued to trend up (+45,000). The\nindustry has added 219,000 jobs over the last 4 months. \n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing continued on an upward trend in November\n(+16,000). Within the industry, job gains occurred in warehousing and storage (+8,000)\nand in couriers and messengers (+5,000). \n\nFinancial activities employment also continued to trend up in November (+13,000), with\na gain of 7,000 in credit intermediation and related activities. Financial activities\nhas added 116,000 jobs over the last 12 months. \n\nMining lost jobs in November (-7,000), largely in support activities for mining (-6,000).\nMining employment is down by 19,000 since a recent peak in May. \n\nIn November, employment in retail trade was about unchanged (+2,000). Within the industry,\nemployment rose in general merchandise stores (+22,000) and in motor vehicle and parts\ndealers (+8,000), while clothing and clothing accessories stores lost jobs (-18,000).\n\nEmployment in other major industries--including construction, wholesale trade, information,\nand government--showed little change over the month. \n\nIn November, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose\nby 7 cents to $28.29. Over the last 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by\n3.1 percent. In November, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and\nnonsupervisory employees rose by 7 cents to $23.83. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.4\nhours in November. In manufacturing, the average workweek increased by 0.1 hour to 40.5\nhours, while overtime decreased by 0.1 hour to 3.1 hours. The average workweek of private-\nsector production and nonsupervisory employees held at 33.5 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for September was revised up by 13,000 from\n+180,000 to +193,000, and the change for October was revised up by 28,000 from +128,000\nto +156,000.

Notable job gains occurred in health care and\nin professional and technical services. \n\nThis news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household\nsurvey measures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic\ncharacteristics. The establishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours,\nand earnings by industry. For more information about the concepts and\nstatistical methodology used in these two surveys, see the Technical Note. \n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate remained at 3.8 percent in March, and the number of\nunemployed persons was essentially unchanged at 6.2 million. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men\n(3.6 percent), adult women (3.3 percent), teenagers (12.8 percent), Whites\n(3.4 percent), Blacks (6.7 percent), Asians (3.1 percent), and Hispanics\n(4.7 percent) showed little or no change in March. (See tables A-1, A-2,\nand A-3.)\n\nIn March, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks\nor more) was essentially unchanged at 1.3 million and accounted for 21.1\npercent of the unemployed. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate, at 63.0 percent, was little changed\nover the month and has shown little movement on net over the past 12 months.\nThe employment-population ratio was 60.6 percent in March and has been\neither 60.6 percent or 60.7 percent since October 2018. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes\nreferred to as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed at 4.5\nmillion in March. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time\nemployment, were working part time because their hours had been reduced\nor they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn March, 1.4 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force,\nlittle different from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.)\nThese individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available\nfor work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They\nwere not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in\nthe 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 412,000 discouraged workers in\nMarch, about unchanged from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally\nadjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work\nbecause they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 944,000\npersons marginally attached to the labor force in March had not searched\nfor work for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.\n(See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 196,000 in March, with notable\ngains in health care and in professional and technical services. Employment\ngrowth averaged 180,000 per month in the first quarter of 2019, compared\nwith 223,000 per month in 2018. (See table B-1.)\n\nHealth care added 49,000 jobs in March and 398,000 over the past 12 months.\nOver the month, employment increased in ambulatory health care services (+27,000),\nhospitals (+14,000), and nursing and residential care facilities (+9,000).  \n\nEmployment in professional and technical services grew by 34,000 in March\nand 311,000 over the past 12 months. In March, computer systems design and\nrelated services added 12,000 jobs. Employment continued to trend up in\narchitectural and engineering services (+6,000) and in management and technical\nconsulting services (+6,000). \n\nIn March, employment in food services and drinking places continued its\nupward trend (+27,000), in line with its average monthly gain over the prior\n12 months.  \n \nEmployment in construction showed little change in March (+16,000) but has\nincreased by 246,000 over the past 12 months. \n \nManufacturing employment changed little for the second month in a row (-6,000\nin March, following +1,000 in February). In the 12 months prior to February,\nmanufacturing had added an average of 22,000 jobs per month. Within the\nindustry, employment in motor vehicles and parts declined in March (-6,000). \n\nEmployment in other major industries, including mining, wholesale trade,\nretail trade, transportation and warehousing, information, financial\nactivities, and government, showed little change over the month. \n \nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased\nby 0.1 hour to 34.5 hours in March, offsetting a decline of 0.1 hour in\nFebruary. In manufacturing, the average workweek was unchanged in March at\n40.7 hours, while overtime decreased by 0.1 hour to 3.4 hours. The average\nworkweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm\npayrolls rose by 0.1 hour to 33.7 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.) \n \nIn March, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm\npayrolls rose by 4 cents to $27.70, following a 10-cent gain in February.\nOver the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 3.2 percent.\nAverage hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory\nemployees increased by 6 cents to $23.24 in March.

See the notes beginning at the end of this news release for    |\n|   more information about these changes.\t\t\t\t      |\n|_____________________________________________________________________________|\n\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nBoth the unemployment rate, at 4.0 percent, and the number of unemployed persons,\nat 6.5 million, edged up in January. The impact of the partial federal government\nshutdown contributed to the uptick in these measures. Among the unemployed, the\nnumber who reported being on temporary layoff increased by 175,000. This figure\nincludes furloughed federal employees who were classified as unemployed on\ntemporary layoff under the definitions used in the household survey. (See tables\nA-1 and A-11. For information about annual population adjustments to the household\nsurvey estimates, see the note at the end of this release and tables B and C. For\nmore information on the classification of workers affected by the partial federal\ngovernment shutdown, see the box note at the end of this news release.) \n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for Hispanics increased to\n4.9 percent in January. The jobless rates for adult men (3.7 percent), adult\nwomen (3.6 percent), teenagers (12.9 percent), Whites (3.5 percent), Blacks\n(6.8 percent), and Asians (3.1 percent) showed little change over the month. (See\ntables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nIn January, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more)\nwas little changed at 1.3 million and accounted for 19.3 percent of the unemployed.\n(See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate, at 63.2 percent, and the employment-population\nratio, at 60.7 percent, changed little over the month; both measures were up by 0.5\npercentage point over the year. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred\nto as involuntary part-time workers) increased by about one-half million to 5.1\nmillion in January. Nearly all of this increase occurred in the private sector and\nmay reflect the impact of the partial federal government shutdown. (Persons employed\npart time for economic reasons would have preferred full-time employment but were\nworking part time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find\nfull-time jobs.) (See table A-8.)\n\nIn January, 1.6 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force,\nessentially unchanged from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.) These\nindividuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and\nhad looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as \nunemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the\nsurvey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 426,000 discouraged workers in January,\nlittle different than a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.)\nDiscouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they\nbelieve no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.2 million persons\nmarginally attached to the labor force in January had not searched for work for\nreasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 304,000 in January, compared with\nan average monthly gain of 223,000 in 2018. In January, employment grew in several\nindustries, including leisure and hospitality, construction, health care, and\ntransportation and warehousing. There were no discernible impacts of the partial\nfederal government shutdown on the estimates of employment, hours, and earnings\nfrom the establishment survey. (See table B-1. For information about the annual\nbenchmark process, see the note at the end of this release and table A. For more\ninformation on the classification of workers affected by the partial federal\ngovernment shutdown, see the box note at the end of this news release.) \n\nIn January, employment in leisure and hospitality rose by 74,000. Within the\nindustry, job gains occurred in food services and drinking places (+37,000) and in\namusements, gambling, and recreation (+32,000). Over the year, leisure and\nhospitality has added 410,000 jobs. \n\nConstruction employment rose by 52,000 in January. Job gains occurred among\nspecialty trade contractors, with increases in both the nonresidential (+19,000)\nand residential (+15,000) components. Employment also rose in heavy and civil\nengineering construction (+10,000) and residential building (+9,000). Construction\nhas added 338,000 jobs over the past 12 months.\n\nEmployment in health care increased by 42,000 in January. Within the industry, job\ngains occurred in ambulatory health care services (+22,000) and hospitals (+19,000).\nHealth care has added 368,000 jobs over the past year.\n\nOver the month, employment in transportation and warehousing rose by 27,000,\nfollowing little change in December. In January, job gains occurred in warehousing\nand storage (+15,000) and among couriers and messengers (+7,000). Over the year,\nemployment in transportation and warehousing has increased by 219,000.\n\nIn January, retail trade employment edged up by 21,000. Job gains occurred in\nsporting goods, hobby, book, and music stores (+17,000), while general merchandise\nstores lost jobs (-12,000). Employment in retail trade has shown little net change\nover the past 12 months (+26,000). \n\nMining employment increased by 7,000 in January. The industry has added 64,000 jobs\nover the year, almost entirely in support activities for mining.\n\nEmployment in professional and business services continued to trend up over the\nmonth (+30,000) and has increased by 546,000 in the past 12 months.\n\nEmployment in manufacturing continued to trend up in January (+13,000). Over-the-\nmonth job gains occurred in durable goods (+20,000), while employment in nondurable\ngoods changed little (-7,000). Manufacturing employment has increased by 261,000\nover the year, with more than four-fifths of the gain in durable goods industries.\n\nEmployment in federal government was essentially unchanged in January (+1,000).\nFederal employees on furlough during the partial government shutdown were counted as\nemployed in the establishment survey because they worked or received pay (or will\nreceive pay) for the pay period that included the 12th of the month. \n\nEmployment showed little change over the month in other major industries, including\nwholesale trade, information, and financial activities.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at\n34.5 hours in January. In manufacturing, both the workweek and overtime decreased by\n0.1 hour to 40.8 hours and 3.5 hours, respectively. The average workweek for\nproduction and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls held at 33.7\nhours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn January, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls\nrose by 3 cents to $27.56, following a 10-cent gain in December. Over the year,\naverage hourly earnings have increased by 85 cents, or 3.2 percent. Average hourly\nearnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees increased by 3\ncents to $23.12 in January. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for November was revised up from\n+176,000 to +196,000, and the change for December was revised down from +312,000 to\n+222,000. With these revisions, employment gains in November and December combined\nwere 70,000 less than previously reported. After revisions, job gains have averaged\n241,000 per month over the last 3 months. (Monthly revisions result from additional\nreports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published\nestimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors. The annual benchmark process\nalso contributed to the November and December revisions.) \n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for February is scheduled to be released on Friday,\nMarch 8, 2019, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\t\n\n   _____________________________________________________________________________\n  |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        |\n  |                     Partial Federal Government Shutdown\t\t        |\n  |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n  |  Some federal government agencies were shut down or operating at reduced\t|\n  |  staffing levels during a lapse in appropriations from December 22, 2018,\t|\n  |  through January 25, 2019. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was\t\t|\n  |  funded during the shutdown period and was operating as usual. Data\t\t|\n  |  collection for the household and establishment surveys occurred as\t\t|\n  |  scheduled.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n  |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n  |  In the household survey, individuals are classified as employed,\t\t|\n  |  unemployed, or not in the labor force based on their answers to a series\t|\n  |  of questions about their activities during the survey reference week.\t|\n  |  Workers who indicated that they were not working during the entire\t\t|\n  |  survey reference week and expected to be recalled to their jobs should\t|\n  |  be classified as unemployed on temporary layoff. In January 2019, there\t|\n  |  was an increase in the number of federal workers who were classified as\t|\n  |  unemployed on temporary layoff. However, there also was an increase in\t|\n  |  the number of federal workers who were classified as employed but absent\t|\n  |  from work. BLS analysis of the underlying data indicates that this group\t|\n  |  included federal workers affected by the shutdown who also should have\t|\n  |  been classified as unemployed on temporary layoff. Such a\t\t\t|\n  |  misclassification is an example of nonsampling error and can occur when\t|\n  |  respondents misunderstand questions or interviewers record answers\t\t|\n  |  incorrectly. If the federal workers who were recorded as employed but\t|\n  |  absent from work had been classified as unemployed on temporary layoff,\t|\n  |  the overall unemployment rate would have been slightly higher than\t\t|\n  |  reported. However, according to usual practice, the data from the\t\t|\n  |  household survey are accepted as recorded. To maintain data integrity,\t|\n  |  no ad hoc actions are taken to reassign survey responses. \t\t\t|\n  |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n  |  In the establishment survey, businesses and government agencies report the |\n  |  number of people on payrolls during the pay period that includes the 12th  |\n  |  of the month. Individuals who work or receive pay for any part of the pay  |\n  |  period are\tdefined as employed. Federal employees on furlough during the   |\n  |  partial federal government shutdown were considered employed in the        |\n  |  establishment survey because they worked or received pay (or will receive  |\n  |  pay) for the pay period that included the 12th of the month. Other workers |\n  |  (including\tfederal contractors) who did not work or receive pay during the |\n  |  partial federal government shutdown were not counted among the employed.\t|\n  |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n  |  Additional information is available online at\t\t\t\t|\n  |  www.bls.gov/bls/shutdown_2019_empsit_qa.pdf.\t\t\t\t|\n  |_____________________________________________________________________________|\t\n\n\n\t         Revisions to Establishment Survey Data\n\nIn accordance with annual practice, the establishment survey data released today\nhave been benchmarked to reflect comprehensive counts of payroll jobs for March\n2018. These counts are derived principally from the Quarterly Census of Employment\nand Wages (QCEW), which counts jobs covered by the Unemployment Insurance (UI) tax\nsystem. The benchmark process results in revisions to not seasonally adjusted data\nfrom April 2017 forward. Seasonally adjusted data from January 2014 forward are\nsubject to revision. In addition, data for some series prior to 2014, both\nseasonally adjusted and unadjusted, incorporate other revisions.                           \n                                                                \nThe total nonfarm employment level for March 2018 was revised downward by 1,000\n(-16,000 on a not seasonally adjusted basis, or less than -0.05 percent). The\nabsolute average benchmark revision over the past 10 years is 0.2 percent. \n\nThe effect of these revisions on the underlying trend in nonfarm payroll employment\nwas minor. For example, the over-the-year change in total nonfarm employment for 2018\nwas revised from +2,638,000 to +2,674,000 (seasonally adjusted). Table A presents\nrevised total nonfarm employment data on a seasonally adjusted basis from January to\nDecember 2018.\n\nAll revised historical establishment survey data are available on the BLS website at\nwww.bls.gov/ces/data.htm. In addition, an article that discusses the benchmark and\npost-benchmark revisions and other technical issues is available at\nwww.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesbmart.htm. \n\n\nTable A.

Population estimates for the household survey are developed by the\nU.S. Census Bureau. Each year, the Census Bureau updates the estimates to reflect new\ninformation and assumptions about the growth of the population since the previous decennial\ncensus. The change in population reflected in the new estimates results from adjustments\nfor net international migration, updated vital statistics, and estimation methodology\nimprovements. \n\nIn accordance with usual practice, BLS will not revise the official household survey\nestimates for December 2018 and earlier months. To show the impact of the population\nadjustments, however, differences in selected December 2018 labor force series based on\nthe old and new population estimates are shown in table B.\n\nThe adjustments decreased the estimated size of the civilian noninstitutional population\nin December by 800,000, the civilian labor force by 506,000, employment by 488,000,\nunemployment by 18,000 and the number of persons not in the labor force was by 294,000.\nThe total unemployment rate, employment-population ratio, and labor force participation\nrate were unaffected.\n\nData users are cautioned that these annual population adjustments can affect the comparability\nof household data series over time. Table C shows the effect of the introduction of new\npopulation estimates on the comparison of selected labor force measures between December 2018\nand January 2019. Additional information on the population adjustments and their effect on\nnational labor force estimates is available at \nhttps://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cps-pop-control-adjustments.pdf.\n\n\n\n    Table B.

A year earlier, the\njobless rate was 4.1 percent, and the number of unemployed persons was 6.6 million. \n(See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.6 percent) and\nBlacks (6.6 percent) increased in December. The jobless rates for adult women (3.5\npercent), teenagers (12.5 percent), Whites (3.4 percent), Asians (3.3 percent), and\nHispanics (4.4 percent) showed little or no change over the month. (See tables A-1,\nA-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of job leavers increased by 142,000 in December to\n839,000. Job leavers are unemployed persons who quit or otherwise voluntarily left\ntheir previous job and immediately began looking for new employment. (See table A-11.)\n\nIn December, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more)\nwas little changed at 1.3 million and accounted for 20.5 percent of the unemployed.\nOver the year, the number of long-term unemployed was down by 205,000. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate, at 63.1 percent, changed little in December, and the\nemployment-population ratio was 60.6 percent for the third consecutive month. Both\nmeasures were up by 0.4 percentage point over the year. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to\nas involuntary part-time workers), at 4.7 million, changed little in December but was\ndown by 329,000 over the year. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time\nemployment, were working part time because their hours had been reduced or they were\nunable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn December, 1.6 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, little\nchanged from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were\nnot in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job\nsometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had\nnot searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 375,000 discouraged workers in December, down\nby 99,000 from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers\nare persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available\nfor them. The remaining 1.2 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in\nDecember had not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or family\nresponsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data \n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 312,000 in December. Job gains occurred\nin health care, food services and drinking places, construction, manufacturing, and\nretail trade. Payroll employment rose by 2.6 million in 2018, compared with a gain of\n2.2 million in 2017. (See table B-1.) \n\nEmployment in health care rose by 50,000 in December. Within the industry, job gains\noccurred in ambulatory health care services (+38,000) and hospitals (+7,000). Health\ncare added 346,000 jobs in 2018, more than the gain of 284,000 jobs in 2017.\n\nIn December, employment in food services and drinking places increased by 41,000. Over\nthe year, the industry added 235,000 jobs, similar to the increase in 2017 (+261,000).\n\nConstruction employment rose by 38,000 in December, with job gains in heavy and civil\nengineering construction (+16,000) and nonresidential specialty trade construction\n(+16,000). The construction industry added 280,000 jobs in 2018, compared with an\nincrease of 250,000 in 2017.\n\nManufacturing added 32,000 jobs in December. Most of the gain occurred in the durable\ngoods component (+19,000), with job growth in fabricated metal products (+7,000) and\nin computer and electronic products (+4,000). Employment in the nondurable goods\ncomponent also increased over the month (+13,000). Manufacturing employment increased\nby 284,000 over the year, with about three-fourths of the gain in durable goods \nindustries. Manufacturing had added 207,000 jobs in 2017.\n\nIn December, employment in retail trade rose by 24,000. Job growth occurred in general\nmerchandise stores (+15,000) and automobile dealers (+6,000). These gains were partially\noffset by a job loss in sporting goods, hobby, book, and music stores (-9,000). Retail\ntrade employment increased by 92,000 in 2018, after little net change in 2017 (-29,000).\n\nOver the month, employment in professional and business services continued to trend up\n(+43,000). The industry added 583,000 jobs in 2018, outpacing the 458,000 jobs added\nin 2017.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including mining, wholesale trade, transportation\nand warehousing, information, financial activities, and government, showed little change\nover the month.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.1 hour\nto 34.5 hours in December. In manufacturing, both the workweek and overtime increased by\n0.1 hour to 40.9 hours and 3.6 hours, respectively. The average workweek for production\nand nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls held at 33.7 hours. (See\ntables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn December, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose\n11 cents to $27.48. Over the year, average hourly earnings have increased by 84 cents,\nor 3.2 percent. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory\nemployees increased by 9 cents to $23.05 in December. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for November was revised up from +155,000\nto +176,000, and the change for October was revised up from +237,000 to +274,000. With\nthese revisions, employment gains in October and November combined were 58,000 more than\npreviously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from\nbusinesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the\nrecalculation of seasonal factors.) After revisions, job gains have averaged 254,000\nper month over the last 3 months.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for January is scheduled to be released on Friday,\nFebruary 1, 2019, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n    __________________________________________________________________________________\n   |                                                                                  |\n   |                       Upcoming Changes to the Household Survey                   |\n   |                                                                                  |\n   |Effective with the release of The Employment Situation for January 2019 on        |\n   |February 1, 2019, new population controls will be used in the household survey    |\n   |estimation process.

Job\ngains occurred in health care, in manufacturing, and in transportation and warehousing.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn November, the unemployment rate was 3.7 percent for the third month in a row, and the\nnumber of unemployed persons was little changed at 6.0 million. Over the year, the\nunemployment rate and the number of unemployed persons declined by 0.4 percentage point\nand 641,000, respectively. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.3 percent),\nadult women (3.4 percent), teenagers (12.0 percent), Whites (3.4 percent), Blacks\n(5.9 percent), Asians (2.7 percent), and Hispanics (4.5 percent) showed little or no\nchange in November. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) declined by\n120,000 to 1.3 million in November. These individuals accounted for 20.8 percent of the\nunemployed. (See table A-12.)\n\nBoth the labor force participation rate, at 62.9 percent, and the employment-population\nratio, at 60.6 percent, were unchanged in November. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as\ninvoluntary part-time workers), at 4.8 million, changed little in November. These\nindividuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time\nbecause their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs.\n(See table A-8.)\n\nIn November, 1.7 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, an increase\nof 197,000 from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals\nwere not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a\njob sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they\nhad not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 453,000 discouraged workers in November, essentially\nunchanged from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are\npersons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for\nthem. The remaining 1.2 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in November\nhad not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.\n(See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 155,000 in November, compared with an\naverage monthly gain of 209,000 over the prior 12 months. In November, job gains occurred\nin health care, in manufacturing, and in transportation and warehousing. (See table B-1.)\n\nHealth care employment rose by 32,000 in November. Within the industry, job gains occurred\nin ambulatory health care services (+19,000) and hospitals (+13,000). Over the year, health\ncare has added 328,000 jobs.\n\nIn November, manufacturing added 27,000 jobs, with increases in chemicals (+6,000) and\nprimary metals (+3,000). Manufacturing employment has increased by 288,000 over the year,\nlargely in durable goods industries.\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing rose by 25,000 in November. Job gains occurred\nin couriers and messengers (+10,000) and in warehousing and storage (+6,000). Over the year,\ntransportation and warehousing has added 192,000 jobs.\n\nIn November, employment in professional and business services continued on an upward trend\n(+32,000). The industry has added 561,000 jobs over the year.\n\nRetail trade employment changed little in November (+18,000). Job growth occurred in general\nmerchandise stores (+39,000) and miscellaneous store retailers (+10,000). These gains were\noffset, in part, by declines in clothing and clothing accessories stores (-14,000);\nelectronics and appliance stores(-11,000); and sporting goods, hobby, and book stores (-11,000).\n\nEmployment in other major industries--including mining, construction, wholesale trade,\ninformation, financial activities, leisure and hospitality, and government--showed little\nchange over the month.  \n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased by 0.1 hour to\n34.4 hours in November. In manufacturing, both the workweek and overtime were unchanged\n(40.8 hours and 3.5 hours, respectively). The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory\nemployees on private nonfarm payrolls held at 33.7 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn November, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 6\ncents to $27.35. Over the year, average hourly earnings have increased by 81 cents, or 3.1\npercent. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees\nincreased by 7 cents to $22.95 in November. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for October was revised down from +250,000 to\n+237,000, and the change for September was revised up from +118,000 to +119,000. With these\nrevisions, employment gains in September and October combined were 12,000 less than previously\nreported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses and\ngovernment agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal\nfactors.)

Over the year, the unemployment rate and\nthe number of unemployed persons declined by 0.4 percentage point and 449,000,\nrespectively. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.5 percent),\nadult women (3.4 percent), teenagers (11.9 percent), Whites (3.3 percent), Blacks\n(6.2 percent), Asians (3.2 percent), and Hispanics (4.4 percent) showed little or no\nchange in October. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was essentially\nunchanged at 1.4 million in October and accounted for 22.5 percent of the unemployed.\n(See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate increased by 0.2 percentage point to 62.9 percent in\nOctober but has shown little change over the year. The employment-population ratio\nedged up by 0.2 percentage point to 60.6 percent in October and has increased by 0.4\npercentage point over the year. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as\ninvoluntary part-time workers) was essentially unchanged at 4.6 million in October.\nThese individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part\ntime because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs.\n(See table A-8.)\n\nIn October, 1.5 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, little\nchanged from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were\nnot in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job\nsometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had\nnot searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 506,000 discouraged workers in October, about\nunchanged from a year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers\nare persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available\nfor them. The remaining 984,000 persons marginally attached to the labor force in\nOctober had not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or family\nresponsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 250,000 in October, following an average\nmonthly gain of 211,000 over the prior 12 months. In October, job growth occurred in\nhealth care, in manufacturing, in construction, and in transportation and warehousing.\n(See table B-1.)\n\nHealth care added 36,000 jobs in October. Within the industry, employment growth\noccurred in hospitals (+13,000) and in nursing and residential care facilities\n(+8,000). Employment in ambulatory health care services continued to trend up\n(+14,000). Over the past 12 months, health care employment grew by 323,000.\n\nIn October, employment in manufacturing increased by 32,000. Most of the increase\noccurred in durable goods manufacturing, with a gain in transportation equipment\n(+10,000). Manufacturing has added 296,000 jobs over the year, largely in durable\ngoods industries.\n\nConstruction employment rose by 30,000 in October, with nearly half of the gain\noccurring among residential specialty trade contractors (+14,000). Over the year,\nconstruction has added 330,000 jobs.\n\nTransportation and warehousing added 25,000 jobs in October. Within the industry,\nemployment growth occurred in couriers and messengers (+8,000) and in warehousing\nand storage (+8,000). Over the year, employment in transportation and warehousing\nhas increased by 184,000.\n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality edged up in October (+42,000). Employment was\nunchanged in September, likely reflecting the impact of Hurricane Florence. The\naverage gain for the 2 months combined (+21,000) was the same as the average monthly\ngain in the industry for the 12-month period prior to September.\n\nIn October, employment in professional and business services continued to trend up\n(+35,000). Over the year, the industry has added 516,000 jobs.\n\nEmployment in mining also continued to trend up over the month (+5,000). The industry\nhas added 65,000 jobs over the year, with most of the gain in support activities for\nmining.\n\nEmployment in other major industries--including wholesale trade, retail trade,\ninformation, financial activities, and government--showed little change over the\nmonth.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.1\nhour to 34.5 hours in October. In manufacturing, the workweek edged down by 0.1 hour\nto 40.8 hours, and overtime was unchanged at 3.5 hours. The average workweek for\nproduction and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls, at 33.7 hours,\nwas unchanged over the month. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn October, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls\nrose by 5 cents to $27.30. Over the year, average hourly earnings have increased by\n83 cents, or 3.1 percent. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and\nnonsupervisory employees increased by 7 cents to $22.89 in October. (See tables B-3\nand B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for September was revised down from\n+134,000 to +118,000, and the change for August was revised up from +270,000 to\n+286,000. The downward revision in September offset the upward revision in August.\n(Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses and\ngovernment agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation\nof seasonal factors.)

(See table A-11.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was essentially \nunchanged at 1.4 million in July and accounted for 22.7 percent of the unemployed. (See table \nA-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate, at 62.9 percent in July, was unchanged over the month and \nover the year. The employment-population ratio, at 60.5 percent, was little changed in July but \nhas increased by 0.3 percentage point over the year. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as \ninvoluntary part-time workers) was little changed in July, at 4.6 million, but was down by \n669,000 over the year. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were \nworking part time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time \njobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn July, 1.5 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, little different from \na year earlier. (Data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor \nforce, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 \nmonths. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 \nweeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 512,000 discouraged workers in July, little changed \nfrom a year earlier. Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because \nthey believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.0 million persons marginally \nattached to the labor force in July had not searched for work for reasons such as school \nattendance or family responsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 157,000 in July, compared with an average monthly \ngain of 203,000 over the prior 12 months. In July, job gains occurred in professional and \nbusiness services, in manufacturing, and in health care and social assistance. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in professional and business services increased by 51,000 in July and has risen by\n518,000 over the year. Over the month, employment edged up in temporary help services (+28,000) \nand in computer systems design and related services (+8,000).\n\nManufacturing added 37,000 jobs in July, with most of the gain in the durable goods component. \nEmployment rose in transportation equipment (+13,000), machinery (+6,000), and electronic \ninstruments (+2,000). Over the past 12 months, manufacturing has added 327,000 jobs.\n\nIn July, employment in health care and social assistance rose by 34,000. Health care employment \ncontinued to trend up over the month (+17,000) and has increased by 286,000 over the year. \nHospitals added 7,000 jobs over the month. Within social assistance, individual and family \nservices added 16,000 jobs in July and 77,000 jobs over the year.\n\nEmployment in food services and drinking places continued to trend up over the month (+26,000). \nOver the year, the industry has added 203,000 jobs. \n\nConstruction employment continued to trend up in July (+19,000) and has increased by 308,000 \nover the year.\n\nIn July, employment in retail trade changed little (+7,000). Job gains occurred in general \nmerchandise stores (+14,000), clothing and clothing accessories stores (+10,000), and food and \nbeverage stores (+8,000). These employment gains were offset by a decline of 32,000 in sporting \ngoods, hobby, book, and music stores, reflecting job losses in hobby, toy, and game stores. \n\nEmployment showed little or no change over the month in other major industries, including \nmining, wholesale trade, transportation and warehousing, information, financial activities, \nand government.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased by 0.1 hour to \n34.5 hours in July, following an increase of 0.1 hour in June. In manufacturing, both the \nworkweek and overtime were unchanged in July, at 40.9 hours and 3.5 hours, respectively. The \naverage workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls \nremained at 33.8 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn July, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 7 cents \nto $27.05. Over the year, average hourly earnings have increased by 71 cents, or 2.7 percent. \nAverage hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees increased by \n3 cents to $22.65 in July. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for May was revised up from +244,000 to\n+268,000, and the change for June was revised up from +213,000 to +248,000. With these \nrevisions, employment gains in May and June combined were 59,000 more than previously \nreported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses and \ngovernment agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of \nseasonal factors.) After revisions, job gains have averaged 224,000 per month over the \nlast 3 months.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for August is scheduled to be released on Friday, September 7, 2018, \nat 8:30 a.m. (EDT).\n\n\n _______________________________________________________________________________________\n|                                                                                       |\n|    2018 Preliminary Benchmark Revision to the Establishment Survey Data will be       |\n|                            Released on August 22, 2018                                |\n|                                                                                       |\n|Each year, the establishment survey estimates are benchmarked to comprehensive counts  |\n|of employment from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) for the month   |\n|of March.

However,\nsome data were also revised further back in their history than normal due to the\nimplementation of 2017 NAICS and other minor technical changes related to rounding and\nre-aggregation of some series.\n\nThe total nonfarm employment level for March 2017 was revised upward by 146,000 (+138,000\non a not seasonally adjusted basis, or +0.1 percent). On a not seasonally adjusted basis,\nthe average absolute benchmark revision over the past 10 years is 0.2 percent.\n\nThe effect of these revisions on the underlying trend in nonfarm payroll employment\nwas minor. For example, the over-the-year change in total nonfarm employment for 2017\nwas revised from +2,055,000 to +2,173,000 (seasonally adjusted). Table A presents\nrevised total nonfarm employment data on a seasonally adjusted basis from January to\nDecember 2017.\n\nAll revised historical establishment survey data are available on the BLS website at\nwww.bls.gov/ces/data.htm. In addition, an article that discusses the benchmark and\npost-benchmark revisions and other technical issues is available at\nwww.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesbmart.htm.\n\n\nTable A.

Population estimates for the household survey are developed by the\nU.S. Census Bureau. Each year, the Census Bureau updates the estimates to reflect new\ninformation and assumptions about the growth of the population since the previous\ndecennial census. The change in population reflected in the new estimates results from\nadjustments for net international migration, updated vital statistics, and estimation\nmethodology improvements.\n\nIn accordance with usual practice, BLS will not revise the official household survey\nestimates for December 2017 and earlier months. To show the impact of the population\nadjustments, however, differences in selected December 2017 labor force series based on\nthe old and new population estimates are shown in table B.\n\nThe adjustments increased the estimated size of the civilian noninstitutional population\nin December by 488,000, the civilian labor force by 333,000, employment by 318,000, and\nunemployment by 15,000. The number of persons not in the labor force was increased by\n154,000. The total unemployment rate, employment-population ratio, and labor force\nparticipation rate were unaffected.\n\nData users are cautioned that these annual population adjustments can affect the\ncomparability of household data series over time. Table C shows the effect of the\nintroduction of new population estimates on the comparison of selected labor force\nmeasures between December 2017 and January 2018. Additional information on the\npopulation adjustments and their effect on national labor force estimates is available\nat www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cps-pop-control-adjustments.pdf\n\n\nTable B.

The\nnumber of unemployed persons, at 6.6 million, was essentially unchanged over the month.\nOver the year, the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed persons were down by\n0.6 percentage point and 926,000, respectively. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for teenagers declined to 13.6\npercent in December, offsetting an increase in November. In December, the unemployment\nrates for adult men (3.8 percent), adult women (3.7 percent), Whites (3.7 percent),\nBlacks (6.8 percent), Asians (2.5 percent), and Hispanics (4.9 percent) showed little\nor no change. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of new entrants decreased by 116,000 in December. New\nentrants are unemployed persons who never previously worked. (See table A-11.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little\nchanged at 1.5 million in December and accounted for 22.9 percent of the unemployed.\nOver the year, the number of long-term unemployed declined by 354,000. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate, at 62.7 percent, was unchanged over the month and\nover the year. The employment-population ratio was unchanged at 60.1 percent in December\nbut was up by 0.3 percentage point over the year. (See table A-1.) \n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as\ninvoluntary part-time workers) was essentially unchanged at 4.9 million in December but\nwas down by 639,000 over the year. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time\nemployment, were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they\nwere unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn December, 1.6 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, about\nunchanged from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals\nwere not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job\nsometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not\nsearched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 474,000 discouraged workers in December, little\nchanged from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers\nare persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available\nfor them. The remaining 1.1 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in\nDecember had not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or family\nresponsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 148,000 in December. Job gains occurred in health\ncare, construction, and manufacturing. In 2017, payroll employment growth totaled 2.1\nmillion, compared with a gain of 2.2 million in 2016. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in health care increased by 31,000 in December. Employment continued to trend\nup in ambulatory health care services (+15,000) and hospitals (+12,000). Health care\nadded 300,000 jobs in 2017, compared with a gain of 379,000 jobs in 2016.\n\nConstruction added 30,000 jobs in December, with most of the increase among specialty\ntrade contractors (+24,000). In 2017, construction employment increased by 210,000,\ncompared with a gain of 155,000 in 2016.\n\nIn December, manufacturing employment rose by 25,000, largely reflecting a gain in\ndurable goods industries (+21,000). Manufacturing added 196,000 jobs in 2017, following\nlittle net change in 2016 (-16,000).\n\nEmployment in food services and drinking places changed little in December (+25,000).\nOver the year, the industry added 249,000 jobs, about in line with an increase of\n276,000 in 2016.\n\nIn December, employment changed little in professional and business services (+19,000).\nIn 2017, the industry added an average of 44,000 jobs per month, in line with its\naverage monthly gain in 2016.\n\nEmployment in retail trade was about unchanged in December (-20,000). Within the industry,\nemployment in general merchandise stores declined by 27,000 over the month. Retail trade\nemployment edged down in 2017 (-67,000), after increasing by 203,000 in 2016.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including mining, wholesale trade, transportation\nand warehousing, information, financial activities, and government, changed little over\nthe month.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at\n34.5 hours in December. In manufacturing, the workweek edged down by 0.1 hour to 40.8\nhours, while overtime remained at 3.5 hours. The average workweek for production and\nnonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 33.8 hours. (See\ntables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn December, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose\nby 9 cents to $26.63. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 65 cents, or\n2.5 percent. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory\nemployees increased by 7 cents to $22.30 in December. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for October was revised down from\n+244,000 to +211,000, and the change for November was revised up from +228,000 to\n+252,000. With these revisions, employment gains in October and November combined were\n9,000 less than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports\nreceived from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and\nfrom the recalculation of seasonal factors.) After revisions, job gains have averaged\n204,000 over the last 3 months.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for January is scheduled to be released on Friday,\nFebruary 2, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n   __________________________________________________________________________________\n  |                                                                                  |\n  |                       Upcoming Changes to the Household Survey                   |\n  |                                                                                  |\n  |Effective with the release of The Employment Situation for January 2018 on        |\n  |February 2, 2018, new population controls will be used in the household survey    |\n  |estimation process.

Over the year, the unemployment rate \nand the number of unemployed persons were down by 0.5 percentage point and 799,000, \nrespectively. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for teenagers increased to 15.9 \npercent in November. The jobless rates for adult men (3.7 percent), adult women (3.7 \npercent), Whites (3.6 percent), Blacks (7.3 percent), Asians (3.0 percent), and Hispanics \n(4.7 percent) showed little change. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was essentially \nunchanged at 1.6 million in November and accounted for 23.8 percent of the unemployed. \nOver the year, the number of long-term unemployed was down by 275,000. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate remained at 62.7 percent in November and has shown no \nclear trend over the past 12 months. The employment-population ratio, at 60.1 percent, \nchanged little in November and has shown little movement, on net, since early this year. \n(See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as \ninvoluntary part-time workers), at 4.8 million, was essentially unchanged in November but \nwas down by 858,000 over the year. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time \nemployment, were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they \nwere unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn November, 1.5 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, down by \n451,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals \nwere not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job \nsometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not \nsearched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 469,000 discouraged workers in November, down by \n122,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers \nare persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for \nthem. The remaining 1.0 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in November \nhad not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities. \n(See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 228,000 in November. Employment continued to \ntrend up in professional and business services, manufacturing, and health care. Employment \ngrowth has averaged 174,000 per month thus far this year, compared with an average monthly \ngain of 187,000 in 2016. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in professional and business services continued on an upward trend in November \n(+46,000). Over the past 12 months, the industry has added 548,000 jobs. \n\nIn November, manufacturing added 31,000 jobs. Within the industry, employment rose in \nmachinery (+8,000), fabricated metal products (+7,000), computer and electronic products \n(+4,000), and plastics and rubber products (+4,000). Since a recent low in November 2016, \nmanufacturing employment has increased by 189,000.\n\nHealth care added 30,000 jobs in November. Most of the gain occurred in ambulatory health \ncare services (+25,000), which includes offices of physicians and outpatient care centers. \nMonthly employment growth in health care has averaged 24,000 thus far in 2017, compared \nwith an average increase of 32,000 per month in 2016. \n\nWithin construction, employment among specialty trade contractors increased by 23,000 in \nNovember and by 132,000 over the year.  \n\nEmployment in other major industries, including mining, wholesale trade, retail trade, \ntransportation and warehousing, information, financial activities, leisure and hospitality, \nand government, changed little over the month. \n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.1 hour \nto 34.5 hours in November. In manufacturing, the workweek was unchanged at 40.9 hours, and \novertime remained at 3.5 hours. The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory \nemployees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 33.7 hours. (See tables B-2 and \nB-7.)\n\nIn November, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose \nby 5 cents to $26.55. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 64 cents, or \n2.5 percent. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory \nemployees rose by 5 cents to $22.24 in November. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for September was revised up from +18,000 \nto +38,000, and the change for October was revised down from +261,000 to +244,000. With \nthese revisions, employment gains in September and October combined were 3,000 more than \npreviously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from \nbusinesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the \nrecalculation of seasonal factors.) After revisions, job gains have averaged 170,000 over \nthe last 3 months. \n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for December is scheduled to be released on Friday, January 5, \n2018, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n    ______________________________________________________________________________________\n   |                                                                                      |\n   |               Revision of Seasonally Adjusted Household Survey Data                  |\n   |                                                                                      |\n   | In accordance with usual practice, The Employment Situation news release for December|\n   | 2017, scheduled for January 5, 2018, will incorporate annual revisions in seasonally |\n   | adjusted household survey data.

Employment\nin food services and drinking places increased sharply, mostly offsetting a decline in\nSeptember that largely reflected the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. In October,\njob gains also occurred in professional and business services, manufacturing, and health\ncare.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate edged down by 0.1 percentage point to 4.1 percent in October, and\nthe number of unemployed persons decreased by 281,000 to 6.5 million. Since January, the\nunemployment rate has declined by 0.7 percentage point, and the number of unemployed\npersons has decreased by 1.1 million. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult women (3.6 percent) and\nWhites (3.5 percent) declined in October. The jobless rates for adult men (3.8 percent),\nteenagers (13.7 percent), Blacks (7.5 percent), Asians (3.1 percent), and Hispanics\n(4.8 percent) showed little change. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nIn October, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was\nlittle changed at 1.6 million and accounted for 24.8 percent of the unemployed. (See\ntable A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate decreased by 0.4 percentage point to 62.7 percent in\nOctober but has shown little movement on net over the past 12 months. The employment-\npopulation ratio declined by 0.2 percentage point over the month to 60.2 percent, after\nincreasing by 0.3 percentage point in September. The employment-population ratio is up\nby 0.5 percentage point over the year. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to\nas involuntary part-time workers) declined by 369,000 to 4.8 million in October. These\nindividuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time\nbecause their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find full-time\njobs. Over the past 12 months, the number of involuntary part-time workers has decreased\nby 1.1 million. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn October, 1.5 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, little\nchanged from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals\nwere not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a\njob sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they\nhad not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 524,000 discouraged workers in October,\nessentially unchanged from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.)\nDiscouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe\nno jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.0 million persons marginally attached\nto the labor force in October had not searched for work for reasons such as school\nattendance or family responsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 261,000 in October, after changing little\nin September (+18,000). Employment in food services and drinking places increased sharply\nover the month, mostly offsetting a decline in September that largely reflected the impact\nof Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. In October, employment also increased in professional and\nbusiness services, manufacturing, and health care. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in food services and drinking places rose sharply in October (+89,000),\nfollowing a decrease of 98,000 in September when many workers were off payrolls due to\nthe hurricanes.\n\nProfessional and business services added 50,000 jobs in October, about in line with its\naverage monthly gain over the prior 12 months.\n\nManufacturing employment rose by 24,000 in October, with job gains in computer and\nelectronic products (+5,000) and chemicals (+4,000). Employment in fabricated metals\ncontinued to trend up (+4,000). Manufacturing has added 156,000 jobs since a recent\nemployment low in November 2016.\n\nHealth care added 22,000 jobs in October. Employment in ambulatory health care services\ncontinued to trend up over the month (+16,000). Health care has added an average of\n24,000 jobs per month thus far in 2017, compared with an average gain of 32,000 per\nmonth in 2016.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including mining, construction, wholesale trade,\nretail trade, transportation and warehousing, information, financial activities, and\ngovernment, changed little in October.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at\n34.4 hours in October. In manufacturing, the workweek increased by 0.2 hour to 41.0\nhours, and overtime edged up by 0.1 hour to 3.5 hours. The average workweek for\nproduction and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged up by\n0.1 hour to 33.7 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nAverage hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls, at $26.53,\nwere little changed in October (-1 cent), after rising by 12 cents in September.\nOver the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 63 cents, or\n2.4 percent. In October, average hourly earnings of private-sector production\nand nonsupervisory employees, at $22.22, were little changed (-1 cent). (See\ntables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for August was revised up from\n+169,000 to +208,000, and the change for September was revised up from -33,000\nto +18,000. With these revisions, employment was 90,000 higher than previously\nreported.

Both measures were down over the year. \n(See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.9 percent) and Blacks \n(7.0 percent) declined in September. The jobless rates for adult women (3.9 percent), teenagers \n(12.9 percent), Whites (3.7 percent), Asians (3.7 percent), and Hispanics (5.1 percent) showed \nlittle change. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was essentially unchanged \nin September at 1.7 million and accounted for 25.5 percent of the unemployed. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe employment-population ratio increased by 0.3 percentage point to 60.4 percent in September and \nhas increased by 0.6 percentage point over the past 12 months. The labor force participation rate, \nat 63.1 percent, changed little over the month and has shown little movement over the year. \n(See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary \npart-time workers) was little changed at 5.1 million in September. These individuals, who would have \npreferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been cut back or \nbecause they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn September, 1.6 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, down by 275,000 from \na year earlier. (These data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor \nforce, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. \nThey were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding \nthe survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 421,000 discouraged workers in September, down by 132,000 \nfrom a year earlier. Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they \nbelieve no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.1 million persons marginally attached to the \nlabor force in September had not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or family \nresponsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment was little changed in September (-33,000), after adding an average \nof 172,000 jobs per month over the prior 12 months. In September, a steep employment decline in food \nservices and drinking places and below-trend growth in some other industries likely reflected the \nimpact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. Employment rose in health care and in transportation and \nwarehousing. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in food services and drinking places dropped sharply in September (-105,000), as many \nworkers were off payrolls due to the recent hurricanes. Over the prior 12 months, food services \nand drinking places had added an average of 24,000 jobs per month. \n\nIn September, health care added 23,000 jobs, in line with its average monthly gain over the prior \n12 months (+27,000). The employment increase in ambulatory health care services (+25,000) was partially \noffset by a decline in nursing care facilities (-9,000). \n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing increased by 22,000 in September. Job gains occurred in \nwarehousing and storage (+5,000), couriers and messengers (+4,000), and air transportation (+3,000). \n\nEmployment in financial activities changed little in September (+10,000). A job gain in insurance \ncarriers and related activities (+11,000) largely reflected hurricane-recovery efforts. The gain was \npartly offset by losses in activities related to credit intermediation (-4,000) and in commercial \nbanking (-3,000). Over the year, financial activities has added 149,000 jobs.\n\nIn September, employment in professional and business services was little changed (+13,000). Over \nthe prior 12 months, job growth in the industry had averaged 50,000 per month.\n\nManufacturing employment was essentially unchanged in September (-1,000). From a recent employment \ntrough in November 2016 through August of this year, the industry had added an average of 14,000 \njobs per month.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including mining, construction, wholesale trade, retail trade, \ninformation, and government, showed little change over the month.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.4 hours in \nSeptember. In manufacturing, the workweek also was unchanged at 40.7 hours, and overtime held steady \nat 3.3 hours. The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm \npayrolls was unchanged at 33.6 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn September, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 12 cents \nto $26.55. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 74 cents, or 2.9 percent. \nIn September, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees \nincreased by 9 cents to $22.23. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n \nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for July was revised down from +189,000 to +138,000, \nand the change for August was revised up from +156,000 to +169,000. With these revisions, employment \ngains in July and August combined were 38,000 less than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result \nfrom additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published \nestimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.)

(See\ntable A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as\ninvoluntary part-time workers) was essentially unchanged at 5.3 million in August and\nhas shown little movement in recent months. These individuals, who would have preferred\nfull-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been cut back or\nbecause they were unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn August, 1.5 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, about the\nsame as a year earlier. (These data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were\nnot in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job\nsometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had\nnot searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 448,000 discouraged workers in August, down\n128,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers\nare persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available\nfor them. The remaining 1.1 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in\nAugust had not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or family\nresponsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 156,000 in August. Job gains occurred in\nmanufacturing, construction, professional and technical services, health care, and\nmining. Employment growth has averaged 176,000 per month thus far this year, about in\nline with the average monthly gain of 187,000 in 2016.

Manufacturing has added 155,000 jobs since a recent employment low\nin November 2016.\n\nIn August, construction employment rose by 28,000, after showing little change over\nthe prior 5 months. Employment among residential specialty trade contractors edged up\nby 12,000 over the month.\n\nEmployment in professional and technical services continued to trend up in August\n(+22,000) and has grown by 262,000 over the last 12 months. In August, job gains\noccurred in computer systems design and related services (+8,000).\n\nHealth care employment continued on an upward trend over the month (+20,000) and has\nrisen by 328,000 over the year. Employment in hospitals edged up over the month\n(+6,000).\n\nMining continued to add jobs in August (+7,000), with all of the growth in support\nactivities for mining. Since a recent low in October 2016, employment in mining has\nrisen by 62,000, or 10 percent.\n\nEmployment in food services and drinking places changed little in August (+9,000),\nfollowing an increase of 53,000 in July. Over the year, the industry has added\n283,000 jobs.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including wholesale trade, retail trade,\ntransportation and warehousing, information, financial activities, and government,\nshowed little change over the month.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls declined by 0.1\nhour to 34.4 hours in August. In manufacturing, the workweek declined by 0.2 hour to\n40.7 hours, while overtime was unchanged at 3.3 hours. The average workweek for\nproduction and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was 33.7 hours\nfor the fifth consecutive month. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn August, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose\nby 3 cents to $26.39, after rising by 9 cents in July. Over the past 12 months, average\nhourly earnings have increased by 65 cents, or 2.5 percent. In August, average hourly\nearnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees increased by 4 cents\nto $22.12. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for June was revised down from +231,000\nto +210,000, and the change for July was revised down from +209,000 to +189,000. With\nthese revisions, employment gains in June and July combined were 41,000 less than\npreviously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from\nbusinesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the\nrecalculation of seasonal factors.) After revisions, job gains have averaged 185,000\nper month over the past 3 months.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for September is scheduled to be released on Friday,\nOctober 6, 2017, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).\n\n\n  ___________________________________________________________________________________\n |                                                                                   |\n |   2017 CES Preliminary Benchmark Revision will be released on September 6, 2017   |\n |                                                                                   |\n |Each year, the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey estimates are benchmarked|\n |to comprehensive counts of employment from the Quarterly Census of Employment and  |\n |Wages (QCEW) for the month of March.

Total employment, as measured by the\nhousehold survey, was up by 457,000 over the month, and the employment-population\nratio edged up to 59.9 percent. (See table A-1. For additional information about the\neffects of the population adjustments, see table C.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to\nas involuntary part-time workers) was little changed in January at 5.8 million. These\nindividuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time\nbecause their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find full-time\njobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn January, 1.8 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, down by\n337,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals\nwere not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a\njob sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they\nhad not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 532,000 discouraged workers in January, little\nchanged from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers\nare persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available\nfor them. The remaining 1.2 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in\nJanuary had not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or family\nresponsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 227,000 in January. Employment increased in\nretail trade, construction, and financial activities. (See table B-1. For information\nabout the annual benchmark process, see the notes at the end of this news release and\ntable A.)\n\nRetail trade employment increased by 46,000 over the month and by 229,000 over the\nyear. Three industries added jobs in January--clothing and clothing accessories\nstores (+18,000), electronics and appliance stores (+8,000), and furniture and home\nfurnishings stores (+6,000).\n\nEmployment in construction rose by 36,000 in January, following little change in\nDecember. Residential building added 9,000 jobs over the month, and employment\ncontinued to trend up among residential specialty trade contractors (+11,000). Over\nthe past 12 months, construction has added 170,000 jobs.\n\nFinancial activities added 32,000 jobs in January, with gains in real estate (+10,000),\ninsurance carriers and related activities (+9,000), and credit intermediation and\nrelated activities (+9,000). Financial activities added an average of 15,000 jobs per\nmonth in 2016.\n\nIn January, employment in professional and technical services rose by 23,000, about in\nline with the average monthly gain in 2016. Over the month, job gains occurred in\ncomputer systems design and related services (+13,000).\n\nEmployment in food services and drinking places continued to trend up in January\n(+30,000). This industry added 286,000 jobs over the past 12 months.\n\nEmployment in health care also continued to trend up in January (+18,000), following a\ngain of 41,000 in December. The industry has added 374,000 jobs over the past 12 months.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including mining and logging, manufacturing,\nwholesale trade, transportation and warehousing, information, and government, showed\nlittle change over the month.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at\n34.4 hours in January. In manufacturing, the workweek edged up by 0.1 hour to 40.8\nhours, while overtime edged down by 0.1 hour to 3.2 hours. The average workweek for\nproduction and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was 33.6 hours\nfor the sixth consecutive month. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn January, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose\nby 3 cents to $26.00, following a 6-cent increase in December. Over the year, average\nhourly earnings have risen by 2.5 percent. In January, average hourly earnings of\nprivate-sector production and nonsupervisory employees increased by 4 cents to $21.84.\n(See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for November was revised down from\n+204,000 to +164,000, and the change for December was revised up from +156,000 to\n+157,000. With these revisions, employment gains in November and December combined\nwere 39,000 lower than previously reported. Monthly revisions result from additional\nreports received from businesses since the last published estimates and from the\nrecalculation of seasonal factors. The annual benchmark process also contributed to\nthe November and December revisions. Over the past 3 months, job gains have averaged\n183,000 per month.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for February is scheduled to be released on Friday,\nMarch 10, 2017, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n                          Revisions to Establishment Survey Data\n\nIn accordance with annual practice, the establishment survey data released today have\nbeen benchmarked to reflect comprehensive counts of payroll jobs for March 2016. These\ncounts are derived principally from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW),\nwhich counts jobs covered by the Unemployment Insurance (UI) tax system. The benchmark\nprocess results in revisions to not seasonally adjusted data from April 2015 forward. \nSeasonally adjusted data from January 2012 forward are subject to revision. In addition,\ndata for some series prior to 2012, both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted, incorporate\nother revisions.\n\nThe total nonfarm employment level for March 2016 was revised downward by 60,000\n(-81,000 on a not seasonally adjusted basis, or -0.1 percent). On a not seasonally\nadjusted basis, the absolute average benchmark revision over the past 10 years is\n0.3 percent.\n\nThe effect of these revisions on the underlying trend in nonfarm payroll employment\nwas minor. For example, the over-the-year change in total nonfarm employment for 2016\nwas revised from 2,157,000 to 2,242,000 (seasonally adjusted). Table A presents\nrevised total nonfarm employment data on a seasonally adjusted basis from January to\nDecember 2016.\n\nAll revised historical establishment survey data are available on the BLS website\nat www.bls.gov/ces/data.htm. In addition, an article that discusses the benchmark\nand post-benchmark revisions and other technical issues is available at\nwww.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesbmart.htm.\n\n\nTable A.

Population estimates for the household survey are developed by the\nU.S. Census Bureau. Each year, the Census Bureau updates the estimates to reflect new\ninformation and assumptions about the growth of the population since the previous\ndecennial census. The change in population reflected in the new estimates results from\nadjustments for net international migration, updated vital statistics, and estimation\nmethodology improvements.\n\nIn accordance with usual practice, BLS will not revise the official household survey\nestimates for December 2016 and earlier months. To show the impact of the population\nadjustments, however, differences in selected December 2016 labor force series based on\nthe old and new population estimates are shown in table B.\n\nThe adjustments decreased the estimated size of December's civilian noninstitutional\npopulation by 831,000, the civilian labor force by 508,000, employment by 487,000, and\nunemployment by 21,000. The number of persons not in the labor force was lowered\nby 323,000. The unemployment rate, employment-population ratio, and labor force\nparticipation rate were unaffected.\n\nData users are cautioned that these annual population adjustments can affect the\ncomparability of household data series over time. Table C shows the effect of the\nintroduction of new population estimates on the comparison of selected labor force\nmeasures between December 2016 and January 2017. Additional information on the\npopulation adjustments and their effect on national labor force estimates is\navailable at www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cps-pop-control-adjustments.pdf.\n\n\nTable B.

However, both measures edged down in the fourth\nquarter, after showing little net change earlier in the year. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (4.4 percent), adult\nwomen (4.3 percent), teenagers (14.7 percent), Whites (4.3 percent), Blacks (7.8 percent),\nAsians (2.6 percent), and Hispanics (5.9 percent) showed little change in December. (See\ntables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was essentially\nunchanged at 1.8 million in December and accounted for 24.2 percent of the unemployed. In\n2016, the number of long-term unemployed declined by 263,000. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe labor force participation rate, at 62.7 percent, changed little in December and was\nunchanged over the year. In December, the employment-population ratio was 59.7 percent\nfor the third consecutive month; this measure showed little change, on net, in 2016.\n(See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (also referred to as\ninvoluntary part-time workers), at 5.6 million, was essentially unchanged in December\nbut was down by 459,000 over the year. These individuals, who would have preferred\nfull-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been cut back or\nbecause they were unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn December, 1.7 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, little\nchanged from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals\nwere not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a\njob sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they\nhad not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 426,000 discouraged workers in December, down\nby 237,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged\nworkers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are\navailable to them. The remaining 1.3 million persons marginally attached to the labor\nforce in December had not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or\nfamily responsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 156,000 in December, with an increase in health\ncare and social assistance. Job growth totaled 2.2 million in 2016, less than the increase\nof 2.7 million in 2015. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in health care rose by 43,000 in December, with most of the increase occurring\nin ambulatory health care services (+30,000) and hospitals (+11,000). Health care added\nan average of 35,000 jobs per month in 2016, roughly in line with the average monthly\ngain of 39,000 in 2015.\n\nSocial assistance added 20,000 jobs in December, reflecting job growth in individual and\nfamily services (+21,000). In 2016, social assistance added 92,000 jobs, down from an\nincrease of 162,000 in 2015. \n\nEmployment in food services and drinking places continued to trend up in December (+30,000).\nThis industry added 247,000 jobs in 2016, fewer than the 359,000 jobs gained in 2015.\n\nEmployment also continued to trend up in transportation and warehousing in December\n(+15,000). Within the industry, employment expanded by 12,000 in couriers and messengers.\nIn 2016, transportation and warehousing added 62,000 jobs, down from a gain of 110,000\njobs in 2015.\n\nEmployment in financial activities continued on an upward trend in December (+13,000).\nThis is in line with the average monthly gains for the industry over the past 2 years.\n\nIn December, employment edged up in manufacturing (+17,000), with a gain of 15,000 in the\ndurable goods component. However, since reaching a recent peak in January, manufacturing\nemployment has declined by 63,000.\n\nEmployment in professional and business services was little changed in December (+15,000),\nfollowing an increase of 65,000 in November. The industry added 522,000 jobs in 2016.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including mining, construction, wholesale trade,\nretail trade, information, and government, changed little in December.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.3\nhours in December. In manufacturing, the workweek edged up by 0.1 hour to 40.7 hours,\nand overtime edged up by 0.1 hour to 3.3 hours. The average workweek for production and\nnonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls remained at 33.6 hours. (See\ntables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn December, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls\nincreased by 10 cents to $26.00, after edging down by 2 cents in November. Over the\nyear, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.9 percent. In December, average hourly\nearnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees increased by 7 cents\nto $21.80. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for October was revised down from +142,000\nto +135,000, and the change for November was revised up from +178,000 to +204,000. With\nthese revisions, employment gains in October and November were 19,000 higher than\npreviously reported. Over the past 3 months, job gains have averaged 165,000 per month.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for January is scheduled to be released on Friday,\nFebruary 3, 2017, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n  ______________________________________________________________________________________\n |                                                                                      |\n |                    Upcoming Changes to the Establishment Survey Data                 |\n |                                                                                      |\n |Effective with the release of January 2017 data on February 3, 2017, the Current      |\n |Employment Statistics (CES) program will begin using an improved methodology to select|\n |models for annual seasonal adjustment processing.

Both measures\nhad shown little movement, on net, from August 2015 through October 2016. (See\ntable A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for adult men declined to 4.3\npercent in November. The rates for adult women (4.2 percent), teenagers (15.2 percent),\nWhites (4.2 percent), Blacks (8.1 percent), Asians (3.0 percent), and Hispanics (5.7 percent)\nshowed little or no change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs edged down by 194,000\nto 3.6 million in November. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27\nweeks or more) was little changed at 1.9 million and accounted for 24.8 percent of the\nunemployed. Over the past 12 months, the number of long-term unemployed was down by\n198,000. (See tables A-11 and A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate, at 62.7 percent, changed little in\nNovember, and the employment-population ratio held at 59.7 percent. These measures\nhave shown little movement in recent months. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to\nas involuntary part-time workers), at 5.7 million, changed little in November but was\ndown by 416,000 over the year. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time\nemployment, were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because\nthey were unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn November, 1.9 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, up by\n215,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals\nwere not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a\njob sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they\nhad not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 591,000 discouraged workers in November, little\ndifferent from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged\nworkers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are\navailable for them.

Job \ngrowth occurred in leisure and hospitality, health care and social assistance, and \nfinancial activities. Employment also increased in information, mostly reflecting \nthe return of workers from a strike.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate increased by 0.2 percentage point to 4.9 percent in June, and \nthe number of unemployed persons increased by 347,000 to 7.8 million. These increases \nlargely offset declines in May and brought both measures back in line with levels \nthat had prevailed from August 2015 to April. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult women (4.5 percent)\nand Whites (4.4 percent) rose in June. The rates for adult men (4.5 percent), \nteenagers (16.0 percent), Blacks (8.6 percent), Asians (3.5 percent), and Hispanics \n(5.8 percent) showed little or no change. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of persons unemployed less than 5 weeks increased by 211,000 in June, \nfollowing a decrease in the prior month. At 2.0 million, the number of long-term \nunemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) changed little in June and accounted \nfor 25.8 percent of the unemployed. (See table A-12.)\n\nIn June, the number of job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs rose by \n203,000 to 3.8 million, after a decline in May. (See table A-11.)\n\nBoth the labor force participation rate, at 62.7 percent, and the employment-population \nratio, at 59.6 percent, changed little in June. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to \nas involuntary part-time workers) decreased by 587,000 to 5.8 million in June, \noffsetting an increase in May. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time \nemployment, were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because \nthey were unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn June, 1.8 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, about \nunchanged from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These \nindividuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had \nlooked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed \nbecause they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See \ntable A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 502,000 discouraged workers in June, down \nby 151,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged \nworkers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are \navailable for them. The remaining 1.3 million persons marginally attached to the \nlabor force in June had not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance \nor family responsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 287,000 in June, after changing little \nin May (+11,000). In June, job growth occurred in leisure and hospitality, health \ncare and social assistance, and financial activities. Employment also rose in \ninformation, largely reflecting the return of workers from a strike. (See table B-1.)\n\nLeisure and hospitality added 59,000 jobs in June, following little employment change \nin the prior month. In June, employment increased in performing arts and spectator \nsports (+14,000), after edging down in May. Employment in food services and drinking \nplaces changed little over the month (+22,000). Job gains in leisure and hospitality \nhave averaged 27,000 per month thus far this year, down from an average of 37,000 in \n2015, reflecting slower job growth in food services and drinking places. \n\nHealth care and social assistance added 58,000 jobs in June. Health care employment \nincreased by 39,000 over the month. Job gains occurred in ambulatory health care \nservices (+19,000) and hospitals (+15,000), about in line with average monthly gains \nover the prior 12 months in each industry. Within social assistance, child day care \nservices added 15,000 jobs in June.\n\nEmployment in financial activities rose by 16,000 in June and has risen by 163,000 \nover the year.\n\nEmployment in information increased by 44,000 in June.

In June, job gains occurred in general merchandise stores (+9,000) \nand in health and personal care stores (+5,000). Retail trade has added 313,000 jobs \nover the year.\n\nEmployment in mining continued to trend down in June (-6,000). Since reaching a peak \nin September 2014, mining has lost 211,000 jobs.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including construction, manufacturing, wholesale \ntrade, transportation and warehousing, and government, showed little or no change in \nJune.\n\nIn June, the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was 34.4 \nhours for the fifth consecutive month. The manufacturing workweek (40.7 hours) and \nmanufacturing overtime (3.3 hours) were also unchanged over the month. The average \nworkweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was \nunchanged at 33.6 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn June, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged \nup (+2 cents) to $25.61, following a 6-cent increase in May. Over the year, average \nhourly earnings have risen by 2.6 percent. Average hourly earnings of private-sector \nproduction and nonsupervisory employees increased by 4 cents to $21.51 in June.

In March, these individuals accounted for 27.6 percent of the unemployed. \n(See table A-12.)\n\nIn March, the labor force participation rate (63.0 percent) and the employment-\npopulation ratio (59.9 percent) changed little. Both measures were up by 0.6 \npercentage point since September. (See table A-1.) \n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (also referred to \nas involuntary part-time workers) was about unchanged in March at 6.1 million and \nhas shown little movement since November. These individuals, who would have \npreferred full-time employment, were working part-time because their hours had been \ncut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn March, 1.7 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, down \nby 335,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These \nindividuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and \nhad looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as \nunemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the \nsurvey.

Over the\nyear, health care employment has increased by 503,000.\n\nOver the month, employment continued to trend up in food services and drinking \nplaces (+25,000) and in financial activities (+15,000). \n\nIn March, employment in professional and business services changed little for the \nthird month in a row. In 2015, the industry added an average of 52,000 jobs per \nmonth.\n\nEmployment in manufacturing declined by 29,000 in March. Most of the job losses \noccurred in durable goods industries (-24,000), including machinery (-7,000), \nprimary metals (-3,000), and semiconductors and electronic components (-3,000). \n\nMining employment continued to decline in March (-12,000) with losses concentrated \nin support activities for mining (-10,000).

Over the past 12 months, the number of \nunemployed persons and the unemployment rate were down by 1.1 million and 0.8 \npercentage point, respectively. (See table A-1. See the note at the end of this\nnews release and tables B and C for information about annual population adjustments\nto the household survey estimates.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (4.5 percent) \nand Whites (4.3 percent) declined in January. The jobless rates for adult women \n(4.5 percent), teenagers (16.0 percent), Blacks (8.8 percent), Asians (3.7 percent), \nand Hispanics (5.9 percent) showed little change over the month. (See tables A-1, \nA-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was \nessentially unchanged in January, at 2.1 million, and has shown little movement \nsince June. These individuals accounted for 26.9 percent of the unemployed. \n(See table A-12.)\n\nAfter accounting for the annual adjustments to the population controls, the civilian \nlabor force and total employment, as measured by the household survey, were little \nchanged in January. The labor force participation rate, at 62.7 percent, was little\nchanged. The employment-population ratio (59.6 percent) changed little over the month\nbut was up by 0.3 percentage point since October. (See table A-1. For additional\ninformation about the effects of the population adjustments, see table C.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred \nto as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed at 6.0 million in January \nbut was down by 796,000 over the year. These individuals, who would have preferred \nfull-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been cut back \nor because they were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn January, 2.1 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, \nlittle different from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These \nindividuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and \nhad looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as \nunemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the \nsurvey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 623,000 discouraged workers in January, \nessentially unchanged from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) \nDiscouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe \nno jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.5 million persons marginally attached \nto the labor force in January had not searched for work for reasons such as school \nattendance or family responsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 151,000 in January. Employment rose \nin several industries, led by retail trade, food services and drinking places, \nhealth care, and manufacturing. Private educational services and transportation \nand warehousing lost jobs. Mining employment continued to decline. (See table B-1 \nand summary table B. See the note at the end of this news release and table A for\ninformation about the annual benchmark process.)\n\nRetail trade added 58,000 jobs in January, following essentially no change in \nDecember. Employment rose in general merchandise stores (+15,000), electronics \nand appliance stores (+9,000), motor vehicle and parts dealers (+8,000), and \nfurniture and home furnishing stores (+7,000). Employment in retail trade has \nincreased by 301,000 over the past 12 months, with motor vehicle and parts dealers \nand general merchandise stores accounting for nearly half of the gain. \n\nEmployment in food services and drinking places rose in January (+47,000). Over \nthe year, the industry has added 384,000 jobs.\n\nHealth care continued to add jobs in January (+37,000), with most of the increase \noccurring in hospitals (+24,000). Health care has added 470,000 jobs over the past \n12 months, with about two-fifths of the growth occurring in hospitals.\n\nManufacturing added 29,000 jobs in January, following little employment change in \n2015. Over the month, job gains occurred in food manufacturing (+11,000), \nfabricated metal products (+7,000), and furniture and related products (+3,000). \n\nEmployment in financial activities rose in January (+18,000). Job gains occurred \nin credit intermediation and related activities (+7,000).\n\nPrivate educational services lost 39,000 jobs in January due to larger than normal \nseasonal layoffs.\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing decreased by 20,000 in January. \nMost of the loss occurred among couriers and messengers (-14,000), reflecting \nlarger than usual layoffs following strong seasonal hiring in the prior 2 months.\n\nEmployment in mining continued to decline in January (-7,000). Since reaching a \npeak in September 2014, employment in the industry has fallen by 146,000, or 17 \npercent.\n\nEmployment in professional and business services changed little in January \n(+9,000), after increasing by 60,000 in December. Within the industry, professional \nand technical services added 25,000 jobs over the month, in line with average \nmonthly gains over the prior 12 months. Employment in temporary help services \nedged down in January (-25,000), after edging up by the same amount in December. \n\nEmployment in other major industries, including construction, wholesale trade, \nand government, changed little over the month.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 0.1 \nhour to 34.6 hours in January. The manufacturing workweek edged up by 0.1 hour \nto 40.7 hours, and factory overtime was unchanged at 3.3 hours. The average \nworkweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls \nwas unchanged at 33.8 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn January, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm \npayrolls increased by 12 cents to $25.39. Over the year, average hourly earnings \nhave risen by 2.5 percent. In January, average hourly earnings of private-sector \nproduction and nonsupervisory employees rose by 6 cents to $21.33. (See tables B-3 \nand B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for November was revised from \n+252,000 to +280,000, and the change for December was revised from +292,000 to \n+262,000. With these revisions, employment gains in November and December combined \nwere 2,000 lower than previously reported. Over the past 3 months, job gains \nhave averaged 231,000 per month. Monthly revisions result from additional \nreports received from businesses since the last published estimates and the \nrecalculation of seasonal factors. The annual benchmark process also \ncontributed to these revisions.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for February is scheduled to be released on Friday, \nMarch 4, 2016, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n\n              Revisions to Establishment Survey Data               \n                                                                \nIn accordance with annual practice, the establishment survey data released \ntoday have been benchmarked to reflect comprehensive counts of payroll jobs \nfor March 2015. These counts are derived principally from the Quarterly \nCensus of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which counts jobs covered by the \nUnemployment Insurance (UI) tax system. The benchmark process results in \nrevisions to not seasonally adjusted data from April 2014 forward. \nSeasonally adjusted data from January 2011 forward are subject to revision. \nIn addition, data for some series prior to 2011, both seasonally adjusted \nand unadjusted, incorporate other revisions.                            \n                                                                \nThe total nonfarm employment level for March 2015 was revised downward by \n206,000 (-199,000 on a not seasonally adjusted basis, or -0.1 percent). The \nabsolute average benchmark revision over the past 10 years is 0.3 percent. \n\nThe effect of these revisions on the underlying trend in nonfarm payroll \nemployment was minor. For example, the over-the-year change in total nonfarm \nemployment for 2015 was revised from 2,650,000 to 2,735,000 (seasonally \nadjusted).

Population estimates for the household \nsurvey are developed by the U.S. Census Bureau. Each year, the Census \nBureau updates the estimates to reflect new information and assumptions \nabout the growth of the population since the previous decennial census. \nThe change in population reflected in the new estimates results from \nadjustments for net international migration and updated vital statistics. \n\nIn accordance with usual practice, BLS will not revise the official household \nsurvey estimates for December 2015 and earlier months. To show the impact \nof the population adjustments, however, differences in selected December \n2015 labor force series based on the old and new population estimates are \nshown in table B.\n\nThe adjustments increased the estimated size of the civilian noninstitutional \npopulation in December by 265,000, the civilian labor force by 218,000, \nemployment by 206,000, and unemployment by 12,000. The number of persons \nnot in the labor force was increased by 47,000. The total unemployment rate, \nemployment-population ratio, and labor force participation rate were \nunaffected.\n\nData users are cautioned that these annual population adjustments can affect \nthe comparability of household data series over time. Table C shows the \neffect of the introduction of new population estimates on the comparison of \nselected labor force measures between December 2015 and January 2016. \nAdditional information on the population adjustments and their effect on \nnational labor force estimates is available at\nwww.bls.gov/cps/population-control-adjustments-2016.pdf.\n\n\nTable B.

Over the past\n12 months, the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed persons were down by 0.6\npercentage point and 800,000, respectively. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for blacks declined to 8.3 percent\nin December, while the rates for adult men (4.7 percent), adult women (4.4 percent),\nteenagers (16.1 percent), whites (4.5 percent), Asians (4.0 percent), and Hispanics\n(6.3 percent) showed little or no change. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was essentially\nunchanged at 2.1 million in December and accounted for 26.3 percent of the unemployed.\nThe number of long-term unemployed has shown little movement since June, but was down\nby 687,000 over the year. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate, at 62.6 percent, was little changed in\nDecember and has shown little movement in recent months. In December, the employment-\npopulation ratio, at 59.5 percent, changed little. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as\ninvoluntary part-time workers) was little changed at 6.0 million in December but was\ndown by 764,000 over the year. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time\nemployment, were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because\nthey were unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn December, 1.8 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, down by\n427,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals\nwere not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a\njob sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they\nhad not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 663,000 discouraged workers in December, little\nchanged from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers\nare persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available\nfor them. The remaining 1.2 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in\nDecember had not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or family\nresponsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 292,000 in December. Employment rose in\nseveral industries, including professional and business services, construction, health\ncare, and food services and drinking places. Mining employment continued to decline. In\n2015, payroll employment growth totaled 2.7 million, compared with 3.1 million in 2014.\n(See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in professional and business services increased by 73,000 in December, with\ntemporary help services accounting for 34,000 of the gain. In 2015, professional and\nbusiness services added 605,000 jobs, compared with a gain of 704,000 in 2014.\n\nConstruction showed strong job growth for the third consecutive month, gaining 45,000\njobs in December. Job gains occurred among specialty trade contractors (+29,000)\nand in construction of buildings (+10,000). Over the year, construction added 263,000\njobs, compared with a gain of 338,000 jobs in 2014.\n\nIn December, health care employment rose by 39,000, with most of the increase occurring\nin ambulatory health care services (+23,000) and hospitals (+12,000). Job growth in\nhealth care averaged 40,000 per month in 2015, compared with 26,000 per month in 2014.\n\nFood services and drinking places added 37,000 jobs in December. In 2015, the industry\nadded 357,000 jobs.\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing rose by 23,000 in December, with a gain of\n15,000 in couriers and messengers.\n\nWithin the information industry, motion pictures and sound recording added 15,000 jobs\nin December, offsetting a decline of 13,000 in the prior month.\n\nEmployment in mining continued to decline in December (-8,000). After adding 41,000 jobs\nin 2014, mining lost 129,000 jobs in 2015, with most of the loss in support activities\nfor mining. \n\nManufacturing employment changed little in December, though its nondurable goods \ncomponent added 14,000 jobs. In 2015, manufacturing employment was little changed\n(+30,000), following strong growth in 2014 (+215,000).\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including wholesale trade, retail trade, financial\nactivities, and government, changed little over the month.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.5\nhours in December. The manufacturing workweek edged down by 0.1 hour to 40.6 hours, and\nfactory overtime edged up by 0.1 hour to 3.3 hours. The average workweek for production\nand nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 33.7 hours.\n(See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn December, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls, at\n$25.24, changed little (-1 cent), following an increase of 5 cents in November. Over the\nyear, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.5 percent. In December, average hourly\nearnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees, at $21.22, changed\nlittle (+2 cents). (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for October was revised from +298,000 to\n+307,000, and the change for November was revised from +211,000 to +252,000. With these\nrevisions, employment gains in October and November combined were 50,000 higher than\npreviously reported. Over the past 3 months, job gains have averaged 284,000 per month.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for January is scheduled to be released on Friday, \nFebruary 5, 2016, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n   -------------------------------------------------------------------\n  |                                                                   |\n  |            Revisions in the Establishment Survey Data             |\n  |                                                                   |\n  | Effective with the release of The Employment Situation for January| \n  | 2016 on February 5, 2016, the Current Employment Statistics (CES) |\n  | survey will introduce revisions to nonfarm payroll employment,    |\n  | hours, and earnings data to reflect the annual benchmark          |\n  | adjustment for March 2015 and updated seasonal adjustment factors.|\n  | Not seasonally adjusted data beginning with April 2014 and        |\n  | seasonally adjusted data beginning with January 2011 are subject  |\n  | to revision.

Mining and information lost jobs.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn November, the unemployment rate held at 5.0 percent, and the number of unemployed\npersons, at 7.9 million, was essentially unchanged. Over the past 12 months, the\nunemployment rate and the number of unemployed persons are down by 0.8 percentage\npoint and 1.1 million, respectively. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (4.7 percent),\nadult women (4.6 percent), teenagers (15.7 percent), whites (4.3 percent), blacks\n(9.4 percent), Asians (3.9 percent), and Hispanics (6.4 percent) showed little or no\nchange in November. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little\nchanged at 2.1 million in November and has shown little movement since June. In \nNovember, these individuals accounted for 25.7 percent of the unemployed. (See\ntable A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate, at 62.5 percent, changed little in\nNovember. The employment-population ratio was unchanged at 59.3 percent and has\nshown little movement since October 2014. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred\nto as involuntary part-time workers) increased by 319,000 to 6.1 million in\nNovember, following declines in September and October. These individuals, who\nwould have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their\nhours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job. Over\nthe past 12 months, the number of persons employed part time for economic reasons\nis down by 765,000. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn November, 1.7 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, down\nby 392,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These\nindividuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and\nhad looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as\nunemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the\nsurvey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 594,000 discouraged workers in November,\nlittle changed from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.)\nDiscouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe\nno jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.1 million persons marginally\nattached to the labor force in November had not searched for work for reasons such\nas school attendance or family responsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 211,000 in November, about in line with the\naverage monthly gain of 237,000 over the prior 12 months. In November, job growth\noccurred in construction, professional and technical services, and health care.\nEmployment in mining and information declined over the month. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in construction rose by 46,000 in November, with much of the increase\noccurring in residential specialty trade contractors (+26,000). Over the past year,\nconstruction employment has grown by 259,000.\n\nIn November, professional and technical services added 28,000 jobs. Job gains\noccurred in accounting and bookkeeping services (+11,000), and employment in \ncomputer systems design and related services continued to trend up (+5,000). Over\nthe year, professional and technical services has added 298,000 jobs.\n\nHealth care employment increased by 24,000 over the month, following a large gain\nin October (+51,000). In November, hospitals added 13,000 jobs. Health care \nemployment has grown by 470,000 over the year.\n\nEmployment in food services and drinking places continued to trend up in November\n(+32,000) and has risen by 374,000 over the year.\n\nRetail trade employment continued to trend up in November (+31,000) and has\nincreased by 284,000 over the year. In November, job gains occurred in general\nmerchandise stores (+12,000) and motor vehicle and parts dealers (+9,000). Over\nthe past 12 months, these industries have added 85,000 jobs and 71,000 jobs,\nrespectively.\n\nEmployment in mining continued to decline in November (-11,000), with losses\nconcentrated in support activities for mining (-7,000). Since a recent peak in\nDecember 2014, employment in mining has declined by 123,000.\n\nInformation lost 12,000 jobs over the month. Within the industry, employment in\nmotion pictures and sound recording decreased by 13,000 in November but has shown\nlittle net change over the year.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including manufacturing, wholesale trade,\ntransportation and warehousing, financial activities, and government, changed\nlittle over the month.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged down by\n0.1 hour to 34.5 hours in November.

Over the year, the unemployment rate and\nthe number of unemployed persons were down by 1.1 percentage points and 1.8 million,\nrespectively. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (5.1 percent),\nadult women (4.9 percent), teenagers (17.5 percent), whites (4.7 percent), blacks\n(10.1 percent), Asians (3.2 percent), and Hispanics (6.8 percent) showed little or\nno change in March.

These individuals accounted for 29.8 percent of the\nunemployed. Over the past 12 months, the number of long-term unemployed has declined\nby 1.1 million. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate was little changed at 62.7 percent in\nMarch.

Within retail trade, general merchandise stores added\n11,000 jobs in March.\n\nEmployment in mining declined by 11,000 in March. The industry has lost 30,000 jobs thus\nfar in 2015, after adding 41,000 jobs in 2014. The employment declines in the first\nquarter of 2015, as well as the gains in 2014, were concentrated in support activities\nfor mining, which includes support for oil and gas extraction.\n\nEmployment in food services and drinking places changed little in March (+9,000),\nfollowing a large increase in the prior month (+66,000). Job growth in the first\nquarter of 2015 averaged 33,000 per month, the same as the average monthly gain\nin 2014.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including construction, manufacturing, wholesale\ntrade, transportation and warehousing, information, financial activities, and government,\nshowed little change over the month.\n\nIn March, the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls declined by\n0.1 hour to 34.5 hours.

These \ncounts are derived principally from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW),\nwhich enumerates jobs covered by the unemployment insurance tax system. The benchmark\nprocess results in revisions to not seasonally adjusted data from April 2013 forward.\nSeasonally adjusted data from January 2010 forward are subject to revision. In addition,\ndata for some series prior to 2010, both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted, incorporate\nrevisions.\n\nThe total nonfarm employment level for March 2014 was revised upward by 91,000 (+67,000\non a not seasonally adjusted basis, or less than 0.05 percent).

Population estimates for the household survey are developed by the\nU.S. Census Bureau. Each year, the Census Bureau updates the estimates to reflect new\ninformation and assumptions about the growth of the population since the previous\ndecennial census. The change in population reflected in the new estimates results\nfrom adjustments for net international migration, updated vital statistics and other\ninformation, and some methodological changes in the estimation process.\n\nIn accordance with usual practice, BLS will not revise the official household survey\nestimates for December 2014 and earlier months. To show the impact of the population\nadjustments, however, differences in selected December 2014 labor force series based on\nthe old and new population estimates are shown in table B.\n\nThe adjustments increased the estimated size of the civilian noninstitutional population\nin December by 528,000, the civilian labor force by 348,000, employment by 324,000, and\nunemployment by 24,000. The number of persons not in the labor force was increased by\n179,000. The total unemployment rate, employment-population ratio, and labor force\nparticipation rate were unaffected.\n\nData users are cautioned that these annual population adjustments can affect the\ncomparability of household data series over time. Table C shows the effect of the\nintroduction of new population estimates on the comparison of selected labor force\nmeasures between December 2014 and January 2015. Additional information on the \npopulation adjustments and their effect on national labor force estimates is\navailable at www.bls.gov/cps/cps15adj.pdf.\n\n\nTable B.

The unemployment rates for    |\n | January 2014 through November 2014 (as originally published and as   |\n | revised) appear in table A, along with additional information about\t|\n | the revisions.                                                       |\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate declined by 0.2 percentage point to 5.6 percent in December, \nand the number of unemployed persons declined by 383,000 to 8.7 million. Over the \nyear, the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed persons were down by 1.1 \npercentage points and 1.7 million, respectively. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for adult women (5.0 percent) \ndecreased by 0.2 percentage point in December, while the rates for adult men (5.3 \npercent), teenagers (16.8 percent), whites (4.8 percent), blacks (10.4 percent), \nand Hispanics (6.5 percent) showed little change. The jobless rate for Asians, at \n4.2 percent (not seasonally adjusted), changed little from a year earlier. (See \ntables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nIn December, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or \nlonger) was essentially unchanged at 2.8 million and accounted for 31.9 percent of \nthe unemployed. Over the year, the number of long-term unemployed has declined by \n1.1 million. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate edged down by 0.2 percentage point \nto 62.7 percent in December. Since April, the participation rate has remained \nwithin a narrow range of 62.7 to 62.9 percent. In December, the employment-\npopulation ratio was 59.2 percent for the third consecutive month. However, the \nemployment-population ratio is up by 0.6 percentage point over the year. (See \ntable A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred \nto as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed in December at 6.8 million. \nThese individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working \npart time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to \nfind a full-time job.  (See table A-8.)\n\nIn December, 2.3 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, \nlittle changed from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These \nindividuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and \nhad looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as \nunemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the \nsurvey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 740,000 discouraged workers in December, \ndown by 177,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) \nDiscouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe \nno jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.5 million persons marginally \nattached to the labor force in December had not searched for work for reasons such \nas school attendance or family responsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 252,000 in December. In 2014, job \ngrowth averaged 246,000 per month, compared with an average monthly gain of 194,000 \nin 2013. In December, employment increased in professional and business services, \nconstruction, food services and drinking places, health care, and manufacturing. \n(See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in professional and business services rose by 52,000 in December. \nMonthly job gains in the industry averaged 61,000 in 2014. In December, employment \nincreased in administrative and waste services (+35,000), computer systems design \nand related services (+9,000), and architectural and engineering services (+5,000). \nEmployment in accounting and bookkeeping services declined (-14,000), offsetting \nan increase of the same amount in November. \n\nConstruction added 48,000 jobs in December, well above the employment gains in \nrecent months. Specialty trade contractors added jobs in December (+26,000), with \nthe gain about equally split between residential and nonresidential contractors. \nEmployment also increased in heavy and civil engineering construction (+12,000) \nand in nonresidential building (+10,000). \n\nIn December, employment in food services and drinking places increased by 44,000. \nThe industry added an average of 30,000 jobs per month in 2014.\n\nHealth care added 34,000 jobs in December. Job gains occurred in ambulatory health \ncare services (+16,000), nursing and residential care facilities (+11,000), and \nhospitals (+7,000). Employment growth in health care averaged 26,000 per month in \n2014 and 17,000 per month in 2013. \n\nIn December, manufacturing employment increased by 17,000, with durable goods \n(+13,000) accounting for most of the gain. Manufacturing added an average of 16,000 \njobs per month in 2014, compared with an average gain of 7,000 jobs per month in \n2013.\n\nEmployment in wholesale trade and in financial activities continued to trend up \nin December.   \n\nEmployment in retail trade changed little in December, following a large gain in \nNovember. Employment in other major industries, including mining and logging, \ntransportation and warehousing, information, and government, changed little in \nDecember. \n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged \nat 34.6 hours in December. The manufacturing workweek edged down by 0.1 hour to \n41.0 hours, and factory overtime edged up by 0.1 hour to 3.6 hours. The average \nworkweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls \nedged up by 0.1 hour to 33.9 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn December, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls \ndecreased by 5 cents to $24.57, following an increase of 6 cents in November. Over \nthe year, average hourly earnings have risen by 1.7 percent. In December, average \nhourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees decreased \nby 6 cents to $20.68.

Over the year, the unemployment rate and\nthe number of unemployed persons were down by 1.2 percentage points and 1.7 million,\nrespectively. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for adult men rose to 5.4 percent\nin November. The rates for adult women (5.3 percent), teenagers (17.7 percent), whites\n(4.9 percent), blacks (11.1 percent), and Hispanics (6.6 percent) showed little change\nover the month. The jobless rate for Asians was 4.8 percent (not seasonally adjusted),\nlittle changed from a year earlier. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little\nchanged at 2.8 million in November. These individuals accounted for 30.7 percent of\nthe unemployed. Over the past 12 months, the number of long-term unemployed declined\nby 1.2 million. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate held at 62.8 percent in November and has\nbeen essentially unchanged since April. The employment-population ratio, at 59.2\npercent, was unchanged in November but is up by 0.6 percentage point over the year.\n(See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to\nas involuntary part-time workers), at 6.9 million, changed little in November. These\nindividuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time\nbecause their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time\njob. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn November, 2.1 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force,\nessentially unchanged from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.)\nThese individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work,\nand had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as\nunemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the\nsurvey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 698,000 discouraged workers in November,\nlittle different from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.)\nDiscouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe\nno jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.4 million persons marginally attached\nto the labor force in November had not searched for work for reasons such as school\nattendance or family responsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 321,000 in November, compared with an\naverage monthly gain of 224,000 over the prior 12 months. In November, job growth\nwas widespread, led by gains in professional and business services, retail trade,\nhealth care, and manufacturing. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in professional and business services increased by 86,000 in November,\ncompared with an average gain of 57,000 per month over the prior 12 months. Within\nthe industry, accounting and bookkeeping services added 16,000 jobs in November.\nEmployment continued to trend up in temporary help services (+23,000), management\nand technical consulting services (+7,000), computer systems design and related\nservices (+7,000), and architectural and engineering services (+5,000).\n\nEmployment in retail trade rose by 50,000 in November, compared with an average\ngain of 22,000 per month over the prior 12 months. In November, job gains occurred\nin motor vehicle and parts dealers (+11,000); clothing and accessories stores\n(+11,000); sporting goods, hobby, book, and music stores (+9,000); and nonstore\nretailers (+6,000).\n\nHealth care added 29,000 jobs over the month. Employment continued to trend up in\noffices of physicians (+7,000), home health care services (+5,000), outpatient care\ncenters (+4,000), and hospitals (+4,000). Over the past 12 months, employment in\nhealth care has increased by 261,000.\n\nIn November, manufacturing added 28,000 jobs. Durable goods manufacturers accounted\nfor 17,000 of the increase, with small gains in most of the component industries.\nEmployment in nondurable goods increased by 11,000, with plastics and rubber products\n(+7,000) accounting for most of the gain. Over the year, manufacturing has added\n171,000 jobs, largely in durable goods.\n\nFinancial activities added 20,000 jobs in November, with half of the gain in insurance\ncarriers and related activities. Over the past year, insurance has contributed 70,000\njobs to the overall employment gain of 114,000 in financial activities.\n\nTransportation and warehousing employment increased by 17,000 in November, with a\ngain in couriers and messengers (+5,000). Over the past 12 months, transportation\nand warehousing has added 143,000 jobs.\n\nEmployment in food services and drinking places continued to trend up in November\n(+27,000) and has increased by 321,000 over the year.\n\nConstruction employment also continued to trend up in November (+20,000). Employment in\nspecialty trade contractors rose by 21,000, mostly in the residential component. Over\nthe past 12 months, construction has added 213,000 jobs, with just over half the gain\namong specialty trade contractors.\n\nIn November, the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose\nby 0.1 hour to 34.6 hours. The manufacturing workweek rose by 0.2 hour to 41.1 hours,\nand factory overtime edged up by 0.1 hour to 3.5 hours. The average workweek for\nproduction and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at\n33.8 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nAverage hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 9 cents\nto $24.66 in November. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.1 percent.\nIn November, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory\nemployees increased by 4 cents to $20.74. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for September was revised from +256,000\nto +271,000, and the change for October was revised from +214,000 to +243,000. With\nthese revisions, employment gains in September and October combined were 44,000 more\nthan previously reported.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for December is scheduled to be released on Friday,\nJanuary 9, 2015, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n\n   __________________________________________________________________________________\n  |                                                                                  |\n  |               Upcoming Changes to the Employment Situation News Release          |\n  |                                                                                  |\n  |Effective with the release of January 2015 data on February 6, 2015, the U.S.     |\n  |Bureau of Labor Statistics will introduce several changes to The Employment       |\n  |Situation news release tables.                                                    |\n  |                                                                                  |\n  |Household survey table A-2 will introduce seasonally adjusted series on the labor |\n  |force characteristics of Asians.

(The data are not seasonally adjusted.) \nThese individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for \nwork, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not \ncounted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks \npreceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 770,000 discouraged workers in \nOctober, essentially unchanged from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally \nadjusted.)

(See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes \nreferred to as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed at 7.2 \nmillion in February. These individuals were working part time because their \nhours had been cut back or because they were unable to find full-time work. \n(See table A-8.)\n\nIn February, 2.3 million persons were marginally attached to the labor \nforce, a decline of 285,000 over the year.

The manufacturing workweek declined by 0.2 hour to 40.7 hours, and factory\novertime edged down by 0.1 hour to 3.4 hours. The average workweek for production and\nnonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 33.5 hours. (See\ntables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nAverage hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 5 cents to\n$24.21. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 46 cents, or 1.9 percent. In\nJanuary, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees\nincreased by 6 cents to $20.39. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for November was revised from +241,000 to\n+274,000, and the change for December was revised from +74,000 to +75,000. With these\nrevisions, employment gains in November and December were 34,000 higher than previously\nreported. Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses since\nthe last published estimates and the monthly recalculation of seasonal factors. The annual\nbenchmark process also contributed to the revisions in this news release.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for February is scheduled to be released on Friday, March 7, 2014,\nat 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n                                  Revisions to Establishment Survey Data\n\n\nIn accordance with annual practice, the establishment survey data released today have been\nbenchmarked to reflect comprehensive counts of payroll jobs for March 2013. These counts\nare derived principally from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which\nenumerates jobs covered by the UI tax system. The benchmark process results in revisions\nto not seasonally adjusted data from April 2012 forward. Seasonally adjusted data from\nJanuary 2009 forward are subject to revision. In addition, data for some series prior to\n2009, both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted, incorporate revisions.\n\nThe total nonfarm employment level for March 2013 was revised upward by 369,000 (+347,000\non a not seasonally adjusted basis, or 0.3 percent). The average benchmark revision over\nthe past 10 years was plus or minus 0.3 percent. \n\nThis revision incorporates the reclassification of jobs in the QCEW. Private household\nemployment is out of scope for the establishment survey. The QCEW reclassified some\nprivate household employment into an industry that is in scope for the establishment\nsurvey--services for the elderly and persons with disabilities. This reclassification\naccounted for an increase of 466,000 jobs in the establishment survey. This increase of\n466,000 associated with reclassification was offset by survey error of -119,000 for a\ntotal net benchmark revision of +347,000 on a not seasonally adjusted basis. Historical\ntime series have been reconstructed to incorporate these revisions. \n\nThe effect of these revisions on the underlying trend in nonfarm payroll employment was\nminor. For example, the over-the-year change in total nonfarm employment for 2013 was\nrevised from 2,186,000 to 2,322,000 seasonally adjusted. Table A presents revised total\nnonfarm employment data on a seasonally adjusted basis for January through December 2013.\n\nAll revised historical CES data, as well as an article that discusses the benchmark and\npost-benchmark revisions and other technical issues can be accessed through the CES\nhomepage at www.bls.gov/ces/. Information on the data released today also may be obtained\nby calling (202) 691-6555.\n\n\nTable A.

Population estimates for the household survey are developed by the U.S.\nCensus Bureau. Each year, the Census Bureau updates the estimates to reflect new information\nand assumptions about the growth of the population since the previous decennial census. The\nchange in population reflected in the new estimates results from adjustments for net\ninternational migration, updated vital statistics and other information, and some\nmethodological changes in the estimation process. \n\nIn accordance with usual practice, BLS will not revise the official household survey estimates\nfor December 2013 and earlier months. To show the impact of the population adjustments, however,\ndifferences in selected December 2013 labor force series based on the old and new population\nestimates are shown in table B. \n\nThe adjustments increased the estimated size of the civilian noninstitutional population in\nDecember by 2,000, the civilian labor force by 24,000, employment by 22,000, and unemployment\nby 2,000. The number of persons not in the labor force was reduced by 22,000. The total\nunemployment rate, employment-population ratio, and labor force participation rate were\nunaffected. \n\nData users are cautioned that these annual population adjustments can affect the comparability\nof household data series over time. Table C shows the effect of the introduction of new\npopulation estimates on the comparison of selected labor force measures between December 2013\nand January 2014. Additional information on the population adjustments and their effect on\nnational labor force estimates is available at www.bls.gov/cps/cps14adj.pdf.\n\n\nTable B.

Over the year, the number of unemployed persons and the \nunemployment rate were down by 1.9 million and 1.2 percentage points, \nrespectively. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (6.3 \npercent) and whites (5.9 percent) declined in December. The rates for adult \nwomen (6.0 percent), teenagers (20.2 percent), blacks (11.9 percent), and \nHispanics (8.3 percent) showed little change. The jobless rate for Asians \nwas 4.1 percent (not seasonally adjusted), down by 2.5 percentage points \nover the year. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of job losers and persons who completed \ntemporary jobs decreased by 365,000 in December to 5.4 million. The number \nof long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more), at 3.9 \nmillion, showed little change; these individuals accounted for 37.7 percent \nof the unemployed. The number of long-term unemployed has declined by 894,000 \nover the year. (See tables A-11 and A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate declined by 0.2 percentage \npoint to 62.8 percent in December, offsetting a change of the same \nmagnitude in November. In December, the employment-population ratio was \nunchanged at 58.6 percent. The labor force participation rate declined by \n0.8 percentage point over the year, while the employment-population ratio \nwas unchanged. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes \nreferred to as involuntary part-time workers) was essentially unchanged at \n7.8 million in December. These individuals were working part time because \ntheir hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find full-\ntime work. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn December, 2.4 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, \nlittle changed from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) \nThese individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for \nwork, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not \ncounted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks \npreceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 917,000 discouraged workers \nin December, down by 151,000 from a year earlier. Discouraged workers \nare persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs \nare available for them. The remaining 1.5 million persons marginally attached \nto the labor force in December had not searched for work for reasons such as \nschool attendance or family responsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment edged up in December (+74,000). In 2013, \njob growth averaged 182,000 per month, about the same as in 2012 (+183,000 \nper month). In December, job gains occurred in retail trade and wholesale \ntrade, while employment declined in information. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in retail trade rose by 55,000 in December.

Employment increased in transportation and warehousing, health care,\nand manufacturing.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nBoth the number of unemployed persons, at 10.9 million, and the unemployment rate, at\n7.0 percent, declined in November. Among the unemployed, the number who reported being\non temporary layoff decreased by 377,000. This largely reflects the return to work of\nfederal employees who were furloughed in October due to the partial government shutdown.\n(See tables A-1 and A-11.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (6.7 percent),\nadult women (6.2 percent), teenagers (20.8 percent), whites (6.2 percent), blacks\n(12.5 percent), and Hispanics (8.7 percent) changed little in November. The jobless\nrate for Asians was 5.3 percent (not seasonally adjusted), little changed from a year\nearlier. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of persons unemployed less than 5 weeks declined by 300,000 in November,\npartially reflecting the return to work of federal employees on furlough in October.\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was essentially\nunchanged at 4.1 million in November. These individuals accounted for 37.3 percent of\nthe unemployed. The number of long-term unemployed has declined by 718,000 over the\npast 12 months. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force rose by 455,000 in November, after declining by 720,000 in\nOctober. The labor force participation rate changed little (63.0 percent) in November.\nTotal employment as measured by the household survey increased by 818,000 over the\nmonth, following a decline of 735,000 in the prior month. This over-the-month increase\nin employment partly reflected the return to work of furloughed federal government\nemployees. The employment-population ratio increased by 0.3 percentage point to 58.6\npercent in November, reversing a decline of the same size in the prior month. (See\ntable A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to\nas involuntary part-time workers) fell by 331,000 to 7.7 million in November. These\nindividuals were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because\nthey were unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn November, 2.1 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, down by\n409,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals\nwere not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a\njob sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they\nhad not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 762,000 discouraged workers in November, down\nby 217,000 from a year ago. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers\nare persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available\nfor them. The remaining 1.3 million persons marginally attached to the labor  force in\nNovember had not searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or family\nresponsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 203,000 in November. Job growth averaged\n195,000 per month over the prior 12 months. In November, job gains occurred in\ntransportation and warehousing, health care, and manufacturing. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing rose by 31,000 in November, with gains\nin couriers and messengers (+9,000), truck transportation (+8,000), warehousing and\nstorage (+5,000), and air transportation (+3,000).\n\nHealth care employment continued to increase over the month (+28,000). Job gains occurred\nin home healthcare services (+12,000) and offices of physicians (+7,000), while nursing\ncare facilities lost jobs (-4,000). Job growth in health care has averaged 19,000 per\nmonth thus far this year, compared with an average monthly gain of 27,000 in 2012.\n\nIn November, manufacturing added 27,000 jobs. Within the industry, job gains occurred in\nfood manufacturing (+8,000) and in motor vehicles and parts (+7,000).\n\nIn November, employment in professional and business services continued to trend up\n(+35,000). Over the prior 12 months, the industry added an average of 55,000 jobs per\nmonth.\n\nRetail trade employment also continued to expand in November (+22,000). Within the\nindustry, job growth occurred in general merchandise stores (+14,000); in sporting\ngoods, hobby, book, and music stores (+12,000); and in automobile dealers (+7,000).\nOver the prior 12 months, job growth in retail trade averaged 31,000 per month.\n\nWithin leisure and hospitality, employment in food services and drinking places continued\nto trend up in November (+18,000). Job growth in this industry averaged 28,000 per month\nover the prior 12 months.\n\nEmployment in construction continued to trend up in November (+17,000). Monthly job\ngains in the industry averaged 15,000 over the prior 12 months.\n\nFederal government employment continued to decline (-7,000) in November. Over the past\n12 months, federal government employment has decreased by 92,000.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including mining and logging, wholesale trade,\ninformation, and financial activities, showed little or no change in November.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged up by\n0.1 hour to 34.5 hours in November. The manufacturing workweek edged up by 0.1 hour\nto 41.0 hours, and factory overtime edged up by 0.1 hour to 3.5 hours. The average\nworkweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls\nedged up by 0.1 hour to 33.7 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn November, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose\nby 4 cents to $24.15. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 48 cents,\nor 2.0 percent. In November, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory\nemployees increased by 3 cents to $20.31. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for September was revised from +163,000\nto +175,000, and the change for October was revised from +204,000 to +200,000. With\nthese revisions, employment gains in September and October combined were 8,000 higher\nthan previously reported.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for December is scheduled to be released on Friday,\nJanuary 10, 2014, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n\n   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  |                                                                                       |\n  |                           Household Survey Reference Period                           |\n  |                                                                                       |\n  |In the household survey, the reference period for November 2013 was the calendar week  |\n  |that included the 5th of the month.

Employment increased in leisure and \nhospitality, retail trade, professional and technical services, \nmanufacturing, and health care.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nBoth the number of unemployed persons, at 11.3 million, and the\nunemployment rate, at 7.3 percent, changed little in October. Among\nthe unemployed, however, the number who reported being on temporary\nlayoff increased by 448,000. This figure includes furloughed federal\nemployees who were classified as unemployed on temporary layoff under\nthe definitions used in the household survey. (Estimates of the\nunemployed by reason, such as temporary layoff and job leavers, do not\nsum to the official seasonally adjusted measure of total unemployed\nbecause they are independently seasonally adjusted.) For more\ninformation on the classification of workers affected by the federal\ngovernment shutdown, see the box note. (See tables A-1 and A-11.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men\n(7.0 percent), adult women (6.4 percent), teenagers (22.2 percent),\nwhites (6.3 percent), blacks (13.1 percent), and Hispanics (9.1 percent) \nshowed little or no change in October. The jobless rate for Asians was \n5.2 percent (not seasonally adjusted), little changed from a year \nearlier. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or\nmore) was little changed at 4.1 million in October. These individuals\naccounted for 36.1 percent of the unemployed. The number of long-term\nunemployed has declined by 954,000 over the year. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force was down by 720,000 in October. The labor\nforce participation rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 62.8 percent\nover the month. Total employment as measured by the household survey\nfell by 735,000 over the month and the employment-population ratio\ndeclined by 0.3 percentage point to 58.3 percent. This employment\ndecline partly reflected a decline in federal government employment.\n(See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons\n(sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) was little\nchanged at 8.1 million in October. These individuals were working part\ntime because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable\nto find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn October, 2.3 million persons were marginally attached to the labor\nforce, little changed from 2.4 million a year earlier. (The data are\nnot seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor\nforce, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job\nsometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed\nbecause they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the\nsurvey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 815,000 discouraged workers\nin October, essentially unchanged from a year earlier. (The data are\nnot seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not\ncurrently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available\nfor them. The remaining 1.5 million persons marginally attached to the\nlabor force in October had not searched for work for reasons such as\nschool attendance or family responsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 204,000 in October. Job\ngrowth averaged 190,000 per month over the prior 12 months. In\nOctober, job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, retail trade,\nprofessional and technical services, manufacturing, and health care.\nFederal government employment continued to trend down. There were no\ndiscernible impacts of the partial federal government shutdown on the\nestimates of employment, hours, and earnings from the establishment\nsurvey. (See table B-1.)\n\nLeisure and hospitality employment rose by 53,000 in October. Within\nthe industry, employment in food services and drinking places\nincreased by 29,000, the same as its average monthly gain over the\nprior 12 months.\n\nEmployment in retail trade increased by 44,000 in October, compared\nwith an average monthly gain of 31,000 over the prior 12 months. Job\ngrowth was widespread within the industry in October, with gains in\nfood and beverage stores (+12,000), electronics and appliance stores\n(+10,000), sporting goods and hobby stores (+8,000), general\nmerchandise stores (+8,000), and building material and garden supply\nstores (+7,000). Clothing and clothing accessories stores lost 13,000\njobs.\n\nProfessional and technical services employment rose in October\n(+21,000) and has grown by 213,000 over the past 12 months. Within the\nindustry, employment in management and technical consulting services\nrose by 8,000 in October.\n\nManufacturing added 19,000 jobs in October, with job growth occurring\nin motor vehicles and parts (+6,000), wood products (+3,000), and\nfurniture and related products (+3,000). On net, manufacturing\nemployment has changed little since February 2013.\n\nHealth care employment increased over the month (+15,000). Job growth\nin health care has averaged 17,000 per month thus far this year,\ncompared with an average monthly gain of 27,000 in 2012.\n\nIn October, employment showed little or no change elsewhere in the\nprivate sector, including mining and logging, construction, wholesale\ntrade, transportation and warehousing, information, and financial\nactivities.\n\nFederal government employment declined by 12,000 in October. Over the\npast 12 months, federal government employment has decreased by 94,000.\nFederal employees on furlough during the partial government shutdown\nwere still considered employed in the payroll survey because they\nworked or received pay for the pay period that included the 12th of\nthe month. For more information on the classification of workers\naffected by the partial federal government shutdown, see the box note.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was\nunchanged in October at 34.4 hours. The manufacturing workweek was\n40.9 hours, the same as in September, and factory overtime was\nunchanged at 3.4 hours. The average workweek for production and\nnonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged down by 0.1\nhour to 33.6 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn October, average hourly earnings for all employees on private\nnonfarm payrolls edged up by 2 cents to $24.10. Over the year, average\nhourly earnings have risen by 52 cents, or 2.2 percent. In October,\naverage hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees\nedged up by 2 cents to $20.26. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for August was revised\nfrom +193,000 to +238,000, and the change for September was revised\nfrom +148,000 to +163,000. With these revisions, employment gains in\nAugust and September combined were 60,000 higher than previously\nreported.\n\n____________\nThe Employment Situation for November is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, December 6, 2013, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n  |                                                                   |\n  |                Partial Federal Government Shutdown                |\n  |                                                                   |\n  |  Some agencies of the federal government were shut down or were   |\n  |  operating at reduced staffing levels from October 1, 2013,       |\n  |  through October 16, 2013. All household and establishment survey |\n  |  operations, including data collection, were suspended during     |\n  |  that time period. Shortly after the shutdown ended, October data |\n  |  collection for both surveys began. The Bureau of Labor           |\n  |  Statistics (BLS) delayed the publication of this release by 1    |\n  |  week to allow enough time to collect data. The reference periods |\n  |  for the surveys were not changed. The response rate for the      |\n  |  household survey was within its normal range, and the response   |\n  |  rate for the establishment survey was above average.             |\n  |                                                                   |\n  |  In the household survey, individuals are classified as employed, |\n  |  unemployed, or not in the labor force based on their answers to  |\n  |  a series of questions about their activities during the survey   |\n  |  reference week. Workers who indicate that they were not working  |\n  |  during the entire survey reference week and expected to be       |\n  |  recalled to their jobs should be classified in the household     |\n  |  survey as unemployed on temporary layoff. In October 2013, there |\n  |  was an increase in the number of federal workers who were        |\n  |  classified as unemployed on temporary layoff. However, there     |\n  |  also was an increase in the number of federal workers who were   |\n  |  classified as employed but absent from work. BLS analysis of the |\n  |  data indicates that this group included federal workers affected |\n  |  by the shutdown who also should have been classified as          |\n  |  unemployed on temporary layoff. Such a misclassification is an   |\n  |  example of nonsampling error and can occur when respondents      |\n  |  misunderstand questions or interviewers record answers           |\n  |  incorrectly. According to usual practice, the data from the      |\n  |  household survey are accepted as recorded. To maintain           |\n  |  data integrity, no ad hoc actions taken to reassign survey       | \n  |  responses.                                                       |\n  |                                                                   |\n  |  It should be noted that household survey data for federal        |\n  |  workers are available only on a not seasonally adjusted basis.   |\n  |  As a result, over-the-month changes in federal worker data       |\n  |  series cannot be compared with seasonally adjusted over-the-     |\n  |  month changes in total employed and unemployed.                  |\n  |                                                                   |\n  |  In the establishment survey, businesses report the number of     |\n  |  people who work or receive pay for any part of the pay period    |\n  |  that includes the 12th of the month. Persons who work or receive |\n  |  pay for any part of the pay period are defined as employed. This |\n  |  method of classifying workers is the same in all industries,     |\n  |  including the federal government. Federal employees on furlough  |\n  |  during the partial federal government shutdown were still        |\n  |  considered employed in the payroll survey because they worked or |\n  |  received pay for the pay period that included the 12th of the    |\n  |  month.                                                           |\n  |                                                                   |\n  |  Additional information is available online at                    |\n  |  www.bls.gov/bls/shutdown_2013_empsit_qa.pdf.                     |\n  |                                                                   |\n   -------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n",

The number of unemployed persons, at 11.3 million, was\nalso little changed over the month; however, unemployment has decreased by 522,000 since\nJune. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (7.1 percent), adult\nwomen (6.2 percent), teenagers (21.4 percent), whites (6.3 percent), blacks (12.9 percent),\nand Hispanics (9.0 percent) showed little or no change in September. The jobless rate for\nAsians was 5.3 percent (not seasonally adjusted), little changed from a year earlier. \n(See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nIn September, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more)\nwas little changed at 4.1 million. These individuals accounted for 36.9 percent of the\nunemployed. The number of long-term unemployed has declined by 725,000 over the past\nyear. (See table A-12.)\n\nBoth the civilian labor force participation rate, at 63.2 percent, and the employment-\npopulation ratio at 58.6 percent, were unchanged in September. Over the year, the labor\nforce participation rate has declined by 0.4 percentage point, while the employment-\npopulation ratio has changed little. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to\nas involuntary part-time workers) was unchanged at 7.9 million in September. These\nindividuals were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they\nwere unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn September, 2.3 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, down from\n2.5 million a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals\nwere not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a\njob sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they\nhad not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 852,000 discouraged workers in September,\nessentially unchanged from a year earlier.

(See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 780,000 discouraged workers in May, little\nchanged from a year earlier. (These data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged\nworkers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are\navailable for them.

(See the note and tables B and C for information about annual population\nadjustments to the household survey estimates.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (7.3 percent), adult\nwomen (7.3 percent), teenagers (23.4 percent), whites (7.0 percent), blacks (13.8 percent),\nand Hispanics (9.7 percent) showed little or no change in January. The jobless rate for\nAsians was 6.5 percent (not seasonally adjusted), little changed from a year earlier.\n(See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nIn January, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was\nabout unchanged at 4.7 million and accounted for 38.1 percent of the unemployed. (See\ntable A-12.)\n\nBoth the employment-population ratio (58.6 percent) and the civilian labor force\nparticipation rate (63.6 percent) were unchanged in January. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 8.0 million, changed\nlittle in January. These individuals were working part time because their hours had been\ncut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn January, 2.4 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, down by\n366,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals\nwere not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a\njob sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had\nnot searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 804,000 discouraged workers in January, a decline\nof 255,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers\nare persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for\nthem. The remaining 1.6 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in January\nhad not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school\nattendance or family responsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\n\n    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   |                                                                             |\n   |                  Changes to The Employment Situation Data                   |\n   |                                                                             |\n   |Establishment survey data have been revised as a result of the annual        |\n   |benchmarking process and the updating of seasonal adjustment factors.

In 2012, employment growth\naveraged 181,000 per month. In January, job gains occurred in retail trade, construction,\nhealth care, and wholesale trade, while employment edged down in transportation and\nwarehousing. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in retail trade rose by 33,000 in January, compared with an average monthly\ngain of 20,000 in 2012. Within the industry, job growth continued in January in motor\nvehicle and parts dealers (+7,000), electronics and appliance stores (+5,000), and\nclothing stores (+10,000).\n\nIn January, employment in construction increased by 28,000. Nearly all of the job growth\noccurred in specialty trade contractors (+26,000), with the gain about equally split\nbetween residential and nonresidential specialty trade contractors. Since reaching a low\nin January 2011, construction employment has grown by 296,000, with one-third of the gain\noccurring in the last 4 months. However, the January 2013 level of construction employment\nremained about 2 million below its previous peak level in April 2006.\n\nHealth care continued to add jobs in January (+23,000). Within health care, job growth\noccurred in ambulatory health care services (+28,000), which includes doctors' offices\nand outpatient care centers. This gain was partially offset by a loss of 8,000 jobs in\nnursing and residential care facilities. Over the year, health care employment has\nincreased by 320,000.\n\nEmployment increased in wholesale trade (+15,000) in January, with most of the increase\noccurring in its nondurable goods component (+11,000). Since the recent low point in \nMay 2010, wholesale trade has added 291,000 jobs.\n\nMining employment increased (+6,000) over the month; employment in this industry has risen\nby 23,000 over the past 3 months.\n\nEmployment edged down in transportation and warehousing in January (-14,000). Couriers and\nmessengers lost 19,000 jobs over the month, following strong seasonal hiring in\nNovember and December. Air transportation employment decreased by 5,000 in January.\n\nManufacturing employment was essentially unchanged in January and has changed little, on \nnet, since July 2012.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including financial activities, professional and\nbusinesses services, leisure and hospitality, and government, showed little change over\nthe month.\n\nIn January, the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged\nat 34.4 hours. The manufacturing workweek edged down by 0.1 hour to 40.6 hours, and factory\novertime was unchanged at 3.3 hours. The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory\nemployees on private nonfarm payrolls edged down by 0.1 hour to 33.6 hours. (See tables B-2\nand B-7.)\n\nAverage hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 4 cents to\n$23.78. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.1 percent. In January,\naverage hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees increased\nby 5 cents to $19.97. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for November was revised from +161,000 to\n+247,000, and the change for December was revised from +155,000 to +196,000. Monthly\nrevisions result from additional reports received from businesses since the last published\nestimates and the monthly recalculation of seasonal factors. The annual benchmark process\nalso contributed to these revisions.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for February is scheduled to be released on Friday, March 8, 2013,\nat 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n\n                      Revisions to Establishment Survey Data\n\n\nIn accordance with annual practice, the establishment survey data released today have been\nbenchmarked to reflect comprehensive counts of payroll jobs. These counts are derived\nprincipally from unemployment insurance tax records for March 2012. The benchmark process\nresults in revisions to not seasonally adjusted data from April 2011 forward.  Seasonally\nadjusted data from January 2008 forward are subject to revision. In addition, data for some\nseries prior to 2008, both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted, incorporate minor revisions.\n\nThe total nonfarm employment level for March 2012 was revised upward by 422,000 (424,000\non a not seasonally adjusted basis). Table A presents revised total nonfarm employment data\non a seasonally adjusted basis for January through December 2012.\n\nAll revised historical Current Employment Statistics (CES) data, as well as an article that\ndiscusses the benchmark and post-benchmark revisions and other technical issues can be\naccessed through the CES homepage at www.bls.gov/ces/. Information on the data released\ntoday also may be obtained by calling (202) 691-6555.\n\n\n\nTable A.

Population estimates for the household survey are developed by the U.S. Census Bureau. Each\nyear, the Census Bureau updates the estimates to reflect new information and assumptions about the\ngrowth of the population since the previous decennial census. The change in population reflected\nin the new estimates results from adjustments for net international migration, updated vital\nstatistics and other information, and some methodological changes in the estimation process.\n\nIn accordance with usual practice, BLS will not revise the official household survey estimates\nfor December 2012 and earlier months. To show the impact of the population adjustment, however,\ndifferences in selected December 2012 labor force series based on the old and new population\nestimates are shown in table B.\n\nThe adjustment increased the estimated size of the civilian noninstitutional population in December\nby 138,000, the civilian labor force by 136,000, employment by 127,000, unemployment by 9,000, and\npersons not in the labor force by 2,000. The total unemployment rate, employment-population ratio,\nand labor force participation rate were unaffected.\n\nData users are cautioned that these annual population adjustments affect the comparability of\nhousehold data series over time. Table C shows the effect of the introduction of new population\nestimates on the comparison of selected labor force measures between December 2012 and January\n2013. Additional information on the population adjustments and their effect on national labor\nforce estimates are available at www.bls.gov/cps/cps13adj.pdf.\n\n\n\nTable B.

(See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult women\n(7.3 percent) and blacks (14.0 percent) edged up in December, while\nthe rates for adult men (7.2 percent), teenagers (23.5 percent),\nwhites (6.9 percent), and Hispanics (9.6 percent) showed little or no\nchange. The jobless rate for Asians was 6.6 percent (not seasonally\nadjusted), little changed from a year earlier. (See tables A-1, A-2,\nand A-3.)\n\nIn December, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27\nweeks or more) was essentially unchanged at 4.8 million and accounted\nfor 39.1 percent of the unemployed. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate held at 63.6 percent in\nDecember. The employment-population ratio, at 58.6 percent, was \nessentially unchanged over the month. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons\n(sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers), at 7.9\nmillion, changed little in December. These individuals were working\npart time because their hours had been cut back or because they were\nunable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn December, 2.6 million persons were marginally attached to the labor\nforce, essentially unchanged from a year earlier. (These data are not\nseasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force,\nwanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime\nin the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because\nthey had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.\n(See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 1.1 million discouraged\nworkers in December, little changed from a year earlier. (These data\nare not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not\ncurrently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available\nfor them. The remaining 1.5 million persons marginally attached to the\nlabor force in December had not searched for work in the 4 weeks\npreceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family\nresponsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 155,000 in December. In\n2012, employment growth averaged 153,000 per month, the same as the\naverage monthly gain for 2011. In December, employment increased in\nhealth care, food services and drinking places, construction, and\nmanufacturing. (See table B-1.)\n\nHealth care employment continued to expand in December (+45,000). Job\ngains occurred in ambulatory health care services (+23,000), in\nhospitals (+12,000), and in nursing and residential care facilities\n(+10,000). In 2012, health care employment rose by 338,000.\n\nIn December, employment in food services and drinking places rose by\n38,000. In 2012, the industry added an average of 24,000 jobs a month,\nessentially the same as in 2011.\n\nConstruction added 30,000 jobs in December, led by employment\nincreases in construction of buildings (+13,000) and in residential\nspecialty trade contractors (+12,000).\n\nIn December, manufacturing employment rose by 25,000, with small gains\nin a number of component industries. In 2012, factory employment\nincreased by 180,000; most of the growth occurred during the first\nquarter.\n\nEmployment in retail trade changed little in December, after\nincreasing by 143,000 over the prior 3 months. Within the industry,\nemployment in clothing and accessories stores fell by 19,000,\nfollowing gains that totaled 55,000 over the prior 3 months. Elsewhere\nin retail trade, employment in automobile dealers and in food and\nbeverage stores continued to trend up in December.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including mining and logging,\ntransportation and warehousing, financial activities, professional and\nbusinesses services, and government, showed little change over the\nmonth.\n\nIn December, the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm\npayrolls edged up by 0.1 hour to 34.5 hours. The manufacturing\nworkweek edged up by 0.1 hour to 40.7 hours, and factory overtime was\nunchanged at 3.3 hours. The average workweek for production and\nnonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged up by 0.1\nhour to 33.8 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nAverage hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls\nrose by 7 cents to $23.73. Over the year, average hourly earnings have\nrisen by 2.1 percent. In December, average hourly earnings of private-\nsector production and nonsupervisory employees increased by 6 cents to\n$19.92. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for October was revised\nfrom +138,000 to +137,000, and the change for November was revised\nfrom +146,000 to +161,000.\n\n____________\nThe Employment Situation for January is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, February 1, 2013, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n |                                                                  |\n |            Revisions in the Establishment Survey Data            |\n |                                                                  |\n | With the release of January 2013 data on February 1, 2013, the   |\n | Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey will introduce        |\n | revisions to nonfarm payroll employment, hours, and earnings     |\n | data to reflect the annual benchmark adjustment for March 2012   |\n | and updated seasonal adjustment factors.

As a result of this\nprocess, seasonally adjusted data for January 2008 through November\n2012 were subject to revision.\n\nTable A shows the unemployment rates for January 2012 through November\n2012, as first published and as revised. The rates changed by one-\ntenth of a percentage point in 2 of the 11 months and were unchanged\nin the remaining 9 months. Revised seasonally adjusted data for other\nmajor labor force series beginning in December 2011 appear in table B.\n\nAn article describing the seasonal adjustment methodology for the\nhousehold survey data and revised data for January 2012 through\nNovember 2012 is available at www.bls.gov/cps/cpsrs2013.pdf.\n\nHistorical data for the household series contained in the A tables of\nthis release can be accessed at www.bls.gov/cps/cpsatabs.htm.

The number of unemployed\npersons, at 12.0 million, changed little. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (7.2 percent), adult\nwomen (7.0 percent), teenagers (23.5 percent), whites (6.8 percent), and Hispanics (10.0\npercent) showed little or no change in November. The unemployment rate for blacks (13.2\npercent) declined over the month. The jobless rate for Asians was 6.4 percent (not\nseasonally adjusted), little changed from a year earlier. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little\nchanged at 4.8 million in November. These individuals accounted for 40.1 percent of\nthe unemployed. (See table A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate declined by 0.2 percentage point to 63.6 percent\nin November, offsetting an increase of the same amount in October. Total employment was\nabout unchanged in November, following a combined increase of 1.3 million over the prior\n2 months. The employment-population ratio, at 58.7 percent, changed little\nin November. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as\ninvoluntary part-time workers), at 8.2 million in November, was little changed over the\nmonth. These individuals were working part time because their hours had been cut back or\nbecause they were unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn November, 2.5 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, essentially\nunchanged from a year earlier. (These data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals\nwere not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job\nsometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not\nsearched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 979,000 discouraged workers in November, little\nchanged from a year earlier. (These data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers\nare persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for\nthem. The remaining 1.5 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in November\nhad not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school\nattendance or family responsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 146,000 in November. Since the beginning\nof this year, employment growth has averaged 151,000 per month, about the same as the \naverage monthly job gain of 153,000 in 2011. In November, employment rose in retail\ntrade, professional and business services, and health care. (See table B-1.)\n\nRetail trade employment rose by 53,000 in November and has increased by 140,000 over the\npast 3 months. Over the month, job gains occurred in clothing and clothing accessory stores \n(+33,000), in general merchandise stores (+10,000), and in electronics and appliance stores\n(+9,000). Employment in miscellaneous store retailers decreased by 13,000.\n\nIn November, employment in professional and business services rose by 43,000. Employment\ncontinued to increase in computer systems design and related services.\n\nHealth care employment continued to increase in November (+20,000), with gains in hospitals\n(+8,000) and in nursing care facilities (+5,000). Health care has added an average of 26,000\njobs per month this year.\n\nEmployment in wholesale trade edged up over the month (+13,000). Since reaching an employment\ntrough in May 2010, the industry has added 228,000 jobs.\n\nInformation employment also edged up in November (+12,000), with the increase concentrated\nin motion picture and sound recording (+15,000). On net, information employment has changed\nlittle over the past 12 months.\n\nIn November, leisure and hospitality employment continued to trend up (+23,000). Over the\npast 12 months, the industry has added 305,000 jobs.\n\nEmployment in construction declined by 20,000 in November, with much of the loss occurring\nin construction of buildings (-11,000). Since early 2010, employment in construction has\nshown no clear trend.\n\nManufacturing employment changed little over the month. Within the industry, job losses\nin food manufacturing (-12,000) and chemicals (-9,000) more than offset gains in motor\nvehicles and parts (+10,000) and wood products (+3,000). On net, manufacturing employment\nhas changed little since this past spring.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including mining and logging, transportation and\nwarehousing, financial activities, and government, showed little change in November.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls remained at 34.4\nhours in November. The manufacturing workweek edged up by 0.1 hour to 40.6 hours, and\nfactory overtime was unchanged at 3.2 hours. The average workweek for production and\nnonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged up 0.1 hour to 33.7 hours.\n(See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn November, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose\nby 4 cents to $23.63. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen by\n1.7 percent. In November, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and\nnonsupervisory employees edged up by 3 cents to $19.84. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for September was revised from +148,000\nto +132,000, and the change for October was revised from +171,000 to +138,000.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for December is scheduled to be released on Friday,\nJanuary 4, 2013, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n |                                                                                        |\n |                   Revision of Seasonally Adjusted Household Survey Data                |\n |                                                                                        |\n |In accordance with usual practice, The Employment Situation release for December 2012,  |\n |scheduled for January 4, 2013, will incorporate annual revisions in seasonally adjusted |\n |unemployment and other labor force series from the household survey.

Since the beginning of\nthis year, the rate has held in a narrow range of 8.1 to 8.3 percent. The number of\nunemployed persons, at 12.5 million, was little changed in August. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (7.6 percent),\nadult women (7.3 percent), teenagers (24.6 percent), whites (7.2 percent), blacks\n(14.1 percent), and Hispanics (10.2 percent) showed little or no change in August.\nThe jobless rate for Asians was 5.9 percent (not seasonally adjusted), little\nchanged from a year earlier. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nIn August, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more)\nwas little changed at 5.0 million. These individuals accounted for 40.0 percent of\nthe unemployed. (See table A-12.)\n\nBoth the civilian labor force (154.6 million) and the labor force participation rate\n(63.5 percent) declined in August. The employment-population ratio, at 58.3 percent,\nwas little changed. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to\nas involuntary part-time workers) was little changed at 8.0 million in August. These\nindividuals were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because\nthey were unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn August, 2.6 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force,\nessentially unchanged from a year earlier. (These data are not seasonally adjusted.)\nThese individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work,\nand had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as\nunemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.\n(See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 844,000 discouraged workers in August, a\ndecline of 133,000 from a year earlier. (These data are not seasonally adjusted.)\nDiscouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe\nno jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.7 million persons marginally attached\nto the labor force in August had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the\nsurvey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities. (See\ntable A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 96,000 in August. Since the beginning of\nthis year, employment growth has averaged 139,000 per month, compared with an average \nmonthly gain of 153,000 in 2011. In August, employment rose in food services and\ndrinking places, in professional and technical services, and in health care. (See\ntable B-1.)\n\nEmployment in food services and drinking places increased by 28,000 in August and by\n298,000 over the past 12 months.\n\nEmployment in professional and technical services rose in August (+27,000). Job gains\noccurred in computer systems design and related services (+11,000) and management and\ntechnical consulting services (+9,000).\n\nHealth care employment rose by 17,000 in August. Ambulatory health care services and\nhospitals added 14,000 and 6,000 jobs, respectively. From June through August, job \ngrowth in health care averaged 15,000 per month, compared with an average monthly\ngain of 28,000 in the prior 12 months.\n\nUtilities employment increased in August (+9,000). The increase reflects the return\nof utility workers who were off payrolls in July due to a labor-management dispute.\n\nWithin financial activities, finance and insurance added 11,000 jobs in August.\nEmployment in wholesale trade continued to trend up. Employment in temporary help\nservices changed little over the month and has shown little movement, on net, since\nFebruary.\n\nManufacturing employment edged down in August (-15,000). A decline in motor vehicles\nand parts (-8,000) partially offset a gain in July. Auto manufacturers laid off fewer\nworkers for factory retooling than usual in July, and fewer workers than usual were\nrecalled in August.\n\nEmployment in other major industries, including mining and logging, construction,\nretail trade, transportation and warehousing, information, and government, showed\nlittle change over the month.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at\n34.4 hours in August. The manufacturing workweek declined by 0.2 hour to 40.5 hours,\nand factory overtime was unchanged at 3.2 hours. The average workweek for production\nand nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 33.7 hours.\n(See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn August, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged\ndown by 1 cent to $23.52. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings rose by\n1.7 percent. In August, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and\nnonsupervisory employees edged down by 1 cent to $19.75.

Employment was little changed in most other major\nindustries.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nBoth the number of unemployed persons (12.7 million) and the unemployment rate (8.2\npercent) changed little in May. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (7.8 percent) and\nHispanics (11.0 percent) edged up in May, while the rates for adult women (7.4 percent),\nteenagers (24.6 percent), whites (7.4 percent), and blacks (13.6 percent) showed little\nor no change.

These individuals accounted for 42.8 percent of the unemployed.\n(See table A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate increased in May by 0.2 percentage point\nto 63.8 percent, offsetting a decline of the same amount in April. The employment-\npopulation ratio edged up to 58.6 percent in May. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to\nas involuntary part-time workers) edged up to 8.1 million over the month.

(See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment changed little in May (+69,000), following a similar\nchange in April (+77,000). In comparison, the average monthly gain was 226,000 in the\nfirst quarter of the year. In May, employment rose in health care, transportation and\nwarehousing, and wholesale trade, while construction lost jobs. (See table B-1.)\n\nHealth care employment continued to increase in May (+33,000). Within the industry,\nemployment in ambulatory health care services, which includes offices of physicians\nand outpatient care centers, rose by 23,000 over the month. Over the year, health care\nemployment has risen by 340,000.\n\nTransportation and warehousing added 36,000 jobs over the month. Employment gains in\ntransit and ground passenger transportation (+20,000) and in couriers and messengers\n(+5,000) followed job losses in those industries in April.

See the notes at the end of|\n  |the news release for more information about these changes.       |\n  |                                                                 |\n   ----------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate declined by 0.2 percentage point in January to\n8.3 percent; the rate has fallen by 0.8 point since August. (See table\nA-1.) The number of unemployed persons declined to 12.8 million in\nJanuary. (See the note and tables B and C for information about annual\npopulation adjustments to the household survey estimates.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men\n(7.7 percent) and blacks (13.6 percent) declined in January. The\nunemployment rates for adult women (7.7 percent), teenagers (23.2\npercent), whites (7.4 percent), and Hispanics (10.5 percent) were\nlittle changed. The jobless rate for Asians was 6.7 percent, not\nseasonally adjusted. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nIn January, the number of job losers and persons who completed\ntemporary jobs fell to 7.3 million. The number of long-term unemployed\n(those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little changed at 5.5 million\nand accounted for 42.9 percent of the unemployed. (See tables A-11 and\nA-12.)\n\nAfter accounting for the annual adjustments to the population\ncontrols, the employment-population ratio (58.5 percent) rose in\nJanuary, while the civilian labor force participation rate held at\n63.7 percent. (See table A-1. For additional information about the\neffects of the population adjustments, see table C.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 8.2\nmillion, changed little in January. These individuals were working\npart time because their hours had been cut back or because they were\nunable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn January, 2.8 million persons were marginally attached to the labor\nforce, essentially unchanged from a year earlier. (The data are not\nseasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force,\nwanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime\nin the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because\nthey had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.\n(See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 1.1 million discouraged\nworkers in January, little different from a year earlier. (The data\nare not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not\ncurrently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available\nfor them. The remaining 1.7 million persons marginally attached to the\nlabor force in January had not searched for work in the 4 weeks\npreceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family\nresponsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 243,000 in January. Private-\nsector employment grew by 257,000, with the largest employment gains\nin professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, and\nmanufacturing. Government employment was little changed over the\nmonth. (See table B-1.)\n\nProfessional and business services continued to add jobs in January\n(+70,000). About half of the increase occurred in employment services\n(+33,000). Job gains also occurred in accounting and bookkeeping\n(+13,000) and in architectural and engineering services (+7,000).\n\nOver the month, employment in leisure and hospitality increased by\n44,000, primarily in food services and drinking places (+33,000).\nSince a recent low in February 2010, food services has added 487,000\njobs.\n\nIn January, health care employment continued to grow (+31,000). Within\nthe industry, hospitals and ambulatory care services each added 13,000\njobs.\n\nWholesale trade employment increased by 14,000 over the month. Since a\nrecent employment low in May 2010, wholesale trade has added 144,000\njobs.\n\nEmployment in retail trade continued to trend up in January. Job gains\nin department stores (+19,000), health and personal care stores\n(+7,000), and automobile dealers (+7,000) were partially offset by\nlosses in clothing and clothing accessory stores (-14,000). Since an\nemployment trough in December 2009, retail trade has added 390,000\njobs.\n\nIn January, employment in information declined by 13,000, including a\nloss of 8,000 jobs in the motion picture and sound recording industry.\n\nIn the goods-producing sector, manufacturing added 50,000 jobs. Nearly\nall of the increase occurred in durable goods manufacturing, with job\ngrowth in fabricated metal products (+11,000), machinery (+11,000),\nand motor vehicles and parts (+8,000). Durable goods manufacturing has\nadded 418,000 jobs over the past 2 years.\n\nEmployment in construction increased by 21,000 in January, following a\ngain of 31,000 in the previous month. Over the past 2 months,\nnonresidential specialty trade contractors added 30,000 jobs.\n\nMining added 10,000 jobs in January, with most of the gain in support\nactivities for mining (+8,000). Since a recent low in October 2009,\nmining employment has expanded by 172,000.\n\nGovernment employment changed little in January. Over the past 12\nmonths, the sector has lost 276,000 jobs, with declines in local\ngovernment; state government, excluding education; and the U.S. Postal\nService.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was\nunchanged in January. The manufacturing workweek increased by 0.3 hour\nto 40.9 hours, and factory overtime increased by 0.1 hour to 3.4\nhours. The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory\nemployees on private nonfarm payrolls edged up by 0.1 hour to 33.8\nhours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn January, average hourly earnings for all employees on private\nnonfarm payrolls rose by 4 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $23.29. Over the\npast 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 1.9 percent.\nIn January, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and\nnonsupervisory employees edged up by 2 cents, or 0.1 percent, to\n$19.62. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for November was\nrevised from +100,000 to +157,000, and the change for December was\nrevised from +200,000 to +203,000. Monthly revisions result from\nadditional sample reports and the monthly recalculation of seasonal\nfactors. The annual benchmark process also contributed to these\nrevisions.\n\n____________\nThe Employment Situation for February is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, March 9, 2012, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n\n   ----------------------------------------------------------------- \n  |                                                                 |\n  |                 Changes to the Household Survey                 |\n  |                                                                 |\n  |Effective with the collection of household survey data for       |\n  |January 2012, the questions on race and Hispanic or Latino       |\n  |ethnicity were modified to incorporate minor wording changes.    |\n  |                                                                 |\n  |In January 2012, the Census Bureau, which conducts the household |\n  |survey, began a year-long process of reorganizing its regional   |\n  |office structure; for more information on these changes see      |\n  |www.census.gov/newsroom/pdf/General_QAs_FINAL2.pdf.

These counts are derived principally from\n  unemployment insurance tax records for March 2011. In addition, the\n  data were updated to the 2012 North American Industry Classification\n  System (NAICS) from the 2007 NAICS. This update resulted in minor\n  changes to several detailed industries. The benchmark process resulted\n  in revisions to not seasonally adjusted data from April 2010 forward\n  and to seasonally adjusted data from January 2007 forward. Some\n  historical data predating the normal benchmark revision period also\n  were revised due to the implementation of NAICS 2012 and other minor\n  changes related to rounding and the recalculation of aggregate series.\n  \n  Table A presents revised total nonfarm employment data on a seasonally\n  adjusted basis for January through December 2011. The revised data for\n  April 2011 forward incorporate the effect of applying the rate of\n  change measured by the sample to the new benchmark level, as well as\n  updated net business birth/death model adjustments and new seasonal\n  adjustment factors. The November and December 2011 data also reflect\n  the routine incorporation of additional sample receipts into the\n  November final and December second preliminary estimates. The total\n  nonfarm employment level for March 2011 was revised upward by 165,000\n  (162,000 on a not seasonally adjusted basis). The previously published\n  level for December 2011 was revised upward by 266,000 (231,000 on a\n  not seasonally adjusted basis).\n  \n  An article that discusses the benchmark and post-benchmark revisions,\n  the change to NAICS 2012, and the other technical issues, as well as\n  all revised historical Current Employment Statistics (CES) data, can\n  be accessed through the CES homepage at www.bls.gov/ces/.

Population estimates for the household survey are\n  developed by the U.S. Census Bureau. Each year, the Census Bureau\n  updates the estimates to reflect new information and assumptions about\n  the growth of the population during the decade. The change in\n  population reflected in the new estimates results from the\n  introduction of the Census 2010 count as the new population base, \n  adjustments for net international migration, updated vital statistics and\n  other information, and some methodological changes in the estimation\n  process. The vast majority of the population change, however, is due\n  to the change in base population from Census 2000 to Census 2010.\n  \n  In accordance with usual practice, BLS will not revise the official\n  household survey estimates for December 2011 and earlier months. To\n  show the impact of the population adjustment, however, differences in\n  selected December 2011 labor force series based on the old and new\n  population estimates are shown in table B.\n  \n  The adjustment increased the estimated size of the civilian\n  noninstitutional population in December by 1,510,000, the civilian\n  labor force by 258,000, employment by 216,000, unemployment by 42,000,\n  and persons not in the labor force by 1,252,000. Although the total\n  unemployment rate was unaffected, the labor force participation rate\n  and the employment-population ratio were each reduced by 0.3\n  percentage point. This was because the population increase was\n  primarily among persons 55 and older and, to a lesser degree, persons\n  16 to 24 years of age. Both these age groups have lower levels of\n  labor force participation than the general population.\n  \n  Data users are cautioned that these annual population adjustments\n  affect the comparability of household data series over time. Table C\n  shows the effect of the introduction of new population estimates on\n  the comparison of selected labor force measures between December 2011 and\n  January 2012. Additional information on the population adjustments and\n  their effect on national labor force estimates is available at\n  www.bls.gov/cps/cps12adj.pdf.\n  \n  \n  Table B.

Seasonally adjusted           |\n   |    estimates back to January 2007 were subject to revision. The    |\n   |    unemployment rates for January 2011 through November 2011       |\n   |    (as originally published and as revised) appear in table A,     |\n   |    along with additional information about the revisions.          |\n   |                                                                    |\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nBoth the number of unemployed persons (13.1 million) and the unemployment rate \n(8.5 percent) continued to trend down in December. The unemployment rate has \ndeclined by 0.6 percentage point since August. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for adult men decreased \nto 8.0 percent in December. The jobless rates for adult women (7.9 percent), \nteenagers (23.1 percent), whites (7.5 percent), blacks (15.8 percent), and \nHispanics (11.0 percent) showed little change. The jobless rate for Asians \nwas 6.8 percent, not seasonally adjusted. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was \nlittle changed at 5.6 million and accounted for 42.5 percent of the unemployed. \n(See table A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate (64.0 percent) and the employment-\npopulation ratio (58.5 percent) were both unchanged over the month. (See \ntable A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes \nreferred to as involuntary part-time workers) declined by 371,000 to 8.1 \nmillion in December. These individuals were working part time because their \nhours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job. \n(See table A-8.)\n\nAbout 2.5 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force in \nDecember, little different from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally \nadjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were \navailable for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. \nThey were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in \nthe 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 945,000 discouraged workers in \nDecember, a decrease of 373,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally \nadjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work \nbecause they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.6 million \npersons marginally attached to the labor force in December had not searched for \nwork in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or \nfamily responsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 200,000 in December. Over the \npast 12 months, nonfarm payroll employment has risen by 1.6 million. Employment \nin the private sector rose by 212,000 in December and by 1.9 million over the \nyear. Government employment changed little over the month but fell by 280,000 \nover the year. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing rose sharply in December (+50,000). \nAlmost all of the gain occurred in the couriers and messengers industry (+42,000); \nseasonal hiring was particularly strong in December.\n\nRetail trade continued to add jobs in December, with a gain of 28,000. Employment \nin the industry has increased by 240,000 over the past 12 months. Over the month, \njob gains continued in general merchandise stores (+13,000) and in clothing and \nclothing accessories stores (+11,000). Employment in sporting goods, hobby, book, \nand music stores fell by 10,000.\n\nIn December, manufacturing employment expanded by 23,000, following 4 months of \nlittle change. Employment increased in December in transportation equipment \n(+9,000), fabricated metals (+6,000), and machinery (+5,000).\n\nMining employment rose by 7,000 over the month. Over the year, mining added \n89,000 jobs.\n\nHealth care continued to add jobs in December (+23,000); employment in hospitals \nincreased by 10,000. Over the year, health care employment has risen by 315,000.\n\nWithin leisure and hospitality, employment in food services and drinking places \ncontinued to trend up in December (+24,000). Over the year, food services and \ndrinking places has added 230,000 jobs.\n\nConstruction employment changed little in December. Within the industry, \nnonresidential specialty trade contractors added 20,000 jobs over the month, \nmostly offsetting losses over the prior 2 months.\n\nEmployment in professional and business services changed little in December for \nthe second month in a row. The industry added 42,000 jobs per month, on average, \nduring the first 10 months of 2011.\n\nGovernment employment changed little in December but was down by 280,000 over \nthe year. Job losses in 2011 occurred in local government; state government,\nexcluding education; and the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased \nby 0.1 hour to 34.4 hours in December. The manufacturing workweek increased \nby 0.1 hour to 40.5 hours. Factory overtime decreased by 0.1 hour to 3.2 \nhours. The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on \nprivate nonfarm payrolls edged up by 0.1 hour to 33.7 hours. (See tables B-2 \nand B-7.)\n\nIn December, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm \npayrolls rose by 4 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $23.24. Over the past 12 months, \naverage hourly earnings have increased by 2.1 percent. In December, average \nhourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees were \nunchanged at $19.54. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for October was revised from \n+100,000 to +112,000, and the change for November was revised from +120,000 \nto +100,000.\n\n__________\nThe Employment Situation for January is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, February 3, 2012, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------- \n   |                                                                    |\n   |            Upcoming Changes to Establishment Survey Data           |\n   |                                                                    |\n   | With the release of January 2012 data on February 3, 2012, the     |\n   | Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey will introduce revisions|\n   | to nonfarm payroll employment, hours, and earnings data to reflect |\n   | the annual benchmark adjustment for March 2011 and updated         |\n   | seasonal adjustment factors.

As a result of this\nprocess, seasonally adjusted data for January 2007 through November\n2011 were subject to revision.\n\nTable A shows the unemployment rates for January 2011 through November\n2011, as first published and as revised. The rates changed by one-\ntenth of a percentage point in 8 of the 11 months and were unchanged\nin the remaining 3 months. Revised seasonally adjusted data for other\nmajor labor force series beginning in December 2010 appear in table B.\n\nAn article describing the seasonal adjustment methodology for the\nhousehold survey data and revised data for January 2011 through\nNovember 2011 is available at www.bls.gov/cps/cpsrs2012.pdf.\n\nHistorical data for the household series contained in the A-tables \n(A-1--A-16) of this release can be accessed at www.bls.gov/cps/\ncpsatabs.htm.

Employment continued to trend up in retail trade, leisure and\nhospitality, professional and business services, and health care. Government\nemployment continued to trend down.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn November, the unemployment rate declined by 0.4 percentage point to 8.6 percent.\nFrom April through October, the rate held in a narrow range from 9.0 to 9.2 percent.\nThe number of unemployed persons, at 13.3 million, was down by 594,000 in November.\nThe labor force, which is the sum of the unemployed and employed, was down by a\nlittle more than half that amount. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for adult men fell by 0.5\npercentage point to 8.3 percent in November. The jobless rate for whites (7.6\npercent) also declined, while the rates for adult women (7.8 percent), teenagers\n(23.7 percent), blacks (15.5 percent), and Hispanics (11.4 percent) showed little\nor no change. The jobless rate for Asians was 6.5 percent, not seasonally adjusted.\n(See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nIn November, the number of job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs\ndeclined by 432,000 to 7.6 million. The number of long-term unemployed (those\njobless for 27 weeks and over) was little changed at 5.7 million and accounted\nfor 43.0 percent of the unemployed. (See tables A-11 and A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate declined by 0.2 percentage point to\n64.0 percent. The employment-population ratio, at 58.5 percent, changed little.\n(See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred\nto as involuntary part-time workers) dropped by 378,000 over the month to 8.5\nmillion. These individuals were working part time because their hours had been\ncut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn November, 2.6 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force,\nabout the same as a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These\nindividuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and\nhad looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as\nunemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the\nsurvey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 1.1 million discouraged workers in\nNovember, a decrease of 186,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally\nadjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because\nthey believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.5 million persons\nmarginally attached to the labor force in November had not searched for work in \nthe 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family\nresponsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 120,000 in November, in line with the\naverage gain for the prior 12 months (+131,000). The private sector added 140,000\njobs, as employment rose in a number of service-providing industries. Government\nemployment continued to trend down. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in retail trade rose by 50,000 in November, with much of the increase\noccurring in clothing and clothing accessories stores (+27,000) and in electronics\nand appliance stores (+5,000). Since reaching an employment trough in December 2009,\nretailers have added an average of 14,000 jobs per month.\n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality continued to trend up in November (+22,000).\nWithin the industry, food services and drinking places added 33,000 jobs. This gain\nmore than offset a loss of 12,000 jobs in the accommodation industry. In the last\n12 months, leisure and hospitality added 253,000 jobs, largely driven by employment\nincreases in food services and drinking places.\n\nEmployment in professional and business services continued to trend up in November\n(+33,000). Modest job gains continued in temporary help services.\n\nHealth care employment continued to rise in November (+17,000). Within the industry,\nhospitals added 9,000 jobs. Over the past 12 months, health care has added an average\nof 27,000 jobs per month.\n\nManufacturing employment changed little over the month and has remained essentially\nunchanged since July. In November, fabricated metal products added 8,000 jobs, while\nelectronic instruments lost 2,000 jobs.\n\nConstruction employment showed little movement in November. Employment in the\nindustry has shown little change, on net, since early 2010.\n\nGovernment employment continued to trend down in November, with a decline in the U.S.\nPostal Service (-5,000). Employment in both state government and local government has\nbeen trending down since the second half of 2008.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at\n34.3 hours in November. The manufacturing workweek was down by 0.2 hour to 40.3\nhours, offsetting a 0.2 hour gain in the previous month. Factory overtime remained\nat 3.2 hours in November. The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory\nemployees on private nonfarm payrolls edged down by 0.1 hour to 33.6 hours. (See\ntables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nAverage hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased in\nNovember by 2 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $23.18. This decline followed a gain of 7\ncents in October. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by\n1.8 percent. In November, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and\nnonsupervisory employees increased by 2 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $19.54. (See\ntables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for September was revised from\n+158,000 to +210,000, and the change for October was revised from +80,000 to \n+100,000.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for December is scheduled to be released on Friday,\nJanuary 6, 2012, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n    _________________________________________________________________________\n   |                                                                         |\n   |                    Upcoming changes to the Household Survey             |\n   |                                                                         |\n   | In accordance with usual practice, The Employment Situation release for |\n   | December 2011, scheduled for January 6, 2012, will incorporate annual   |\n   | revisions in seasonally adjusted unemployment and other labor force     |\n   | series from the household survey.

These individuals were working part\ntime because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable\nto find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn October, 2.6 million persons were marginally attached to the labor\nforce, about the same as a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally\nadjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and\nwere available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the\nprior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had\nnot searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table\nA-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 967,000 discouraged workers\nin October, a decrease of 252,000 from a year earlier. (The data are\nnot seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not\ncurrently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available\nfor them. The remaining 1.6 million persons marginally attached to the\nlabor force in October had not searched for work in the 4 weeks\npreceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family\nresponsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment continued to trend up in October\n(+80,000). Over the past 12 months, payroll employment has increased\nby an average of 125,000 per month. In October, private-sector\nemployment increased by 104,000, with continued job growth in\nprofessional and business services, leisure and hospitality, health\ncare, and mining. Government employment continued to contract in\nOctober. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in professional and business services continued to trend up\nin October (+32,000) and has grown by 562,000 over the past 12 months.\nWithin the industry, there have been modest job gains in recent months\nin temporary help services and in management and technical consulting\nservices.\n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality edged up over the month\n(+22,000). Since a recent low point in January 2010, the industry has\nadded 344,000 jobs.\n\nHealth care employment continued to expand in October 2011 (+12,000),\nfollowing a gain of 45,000 in September. Offices of physicians added\n8,000 jobs in October. Over the past 12 months, health care has added\n313,000 jobs.\n\nIn October, mining employment continued to increase (+6,000); oil and\ngas extraction accounted for half of the increase. Since a recent low\npoint in October 2009, mining employment has risen by 152,000.\n\nManufacturing employment changed little in October 2011 (+5,000) and has\nremained flat for 3 months. In October, a job gain in transportation\nequipment (+10,000) was partly offset by small losses in other\nmanufacturing industries.\n\nWithin retail trade, employment increased in general merchandise\nstores (+10,000) and in motor vehicle and parts dealers (+6,000) in\nOctober. Retail trade has added 156,000 jobs over the past 12 months.\n\nConstruction employment declined by 20,000 in October, largely\noffsetting an increase of 27,000 in September; both over-the-month\nchanges largely occurred in nonresidential construction. Employment in\nboth residential and nonresidential construction has shown little net\nchange in 2011.\n\nEmployment in other major private-sector industries, including\nwholesale trade, transportation and warehousing, information, and\nfinancial activities, changed little in October.\n\nGovernment employment continued to trend down over the month (-24,000),\nwith most of the October decline in the non-educational component of\nstate government. Employment in both state government and local \ngovernment has been trending down since the second half of 2008.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was\nunchanged at 34.3 hours in October. The manufacturing workweek rose by\n0.2 hour to 40.5 hours, and factory overtime remained at 3.2 hours.\nThe average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on\nprivate nonfarm payrolls edged up by 0.1 hour to 33.7 hours in\nOctober. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn October, average hourly earnings for all employees on private\nnonfarm payrolls increased by 5 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $23.19. This\nincrease followed a gain of 6 cents in September. Over the past 12\nmonths, average hourly earnings have increased by 1.8 percent. In\nOctober, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and\nnonsupervisory employees increased by 3 cents, or 0.2 percent, to\n$19.53. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for August was revised\nfrom +57,000 to +104,000, and the change for September was revised\nfrom +103,000 to +158,000.\n\n\n______________\nThe Employment Situation for November is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, December 2, 2011, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n\n  _________________________________________________________________________\n |                                  \t\t\t\t\t  |\n |             Administrative Changes to Household Survey\t\t  |\n |   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  |\n | In January 2012, the Census Bureau, which conducts the household\t  |\n | survey, will begin a year-long process of reorganizing its regional\t  |\n | office structure.

The \nincrease in employment partially reflected the return to payrolls of about 45,000 \ntelecommunications workers who had been on strike in August. In September, job gains\noccurred in professional and business services, health care, and construction. \nGovernment employment continued to trend down.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe number of unemployed persons, at 14.0 million, was essentially unchanged in \nSeptember, and the unemployment rate was 9.1 percent. Since April, the rate has held \nin a narrow range from 9.0 to 9.2 percent. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (8.8 percent), \nadult women (8.1 percent), teenagers (24.6 percent), whites (8.0 percent), blacks \n(16.0 percent), and Hispanics (11.3 percent) showed little or no change in September. \nThe jobless rate for Asians was 7.8 percent, not seasonally adjusted. (See tables A-1, \nA-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over) was 6.2 \nmillion in September. These individuals accounted for 44.6 percent of the unemployed. \n(See table A-12.)\n\nBoth the labor force and employment increased in September. However, the civilian \nlabor force participation rate, at 64.2 percent, and the employment-population ratio, \nat 58.3 percent, were little changed. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to \nas involuntary part-time workers) rose to 9.3 million in September. These individuals \nwere working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were \nunable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn September, about 2.5 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, \nabout the same as a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These \nindividuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had \nlooked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed \nbecause they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table \nA-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 1.0 million discouraged workers in September, \ndown by 172,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) \nDiscouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe \nno jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.5 million persons marginally attached \nto the labor force in September had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the \nsurvey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities. (See table \nA-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment edged up by 103,000 in September. Since April, payroll \nemployment has increased by an average of 72,000 per month, compared with an average \nof 161,000 for the prior 7 months. In September, job gains occurred in professional \nand business services, health care, and construction. Government employment continued \nto trend down. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in professional and business services increased by 48,000 over the month and \nhas grown by 897,000 since a recent low in September 2009. Employment in temporary help \nservices edged up in September; this industry has added 53,000 jobs over the past 3 \nmonths. In September, employment growth continued in computer systems design and in \nmanagement and technical consulting services.\n\nHealth care employment continued to expand in September, with an increase of 44,000. \nWithin the industry, job gains occurred in ambulatory health care services (+26,000) \nand in hospitals (+13,000).\n\nConstruction employment increased by 26,000 over the month, after showing little \nmovement since February. The over-the-month gain was due to employment increases in the \nnonresidential construction industries, which includes heavy and civil construction. \nMining employment continued to trend up in September.\n\nEmployment in information was up by 34,000 over the month due to the return of about\n45,000 telecommunications workers to payrolls after an August strike.\n\nManufacturing employment changed little in September (-13,000) and has been essentially \nflat for the past 2 months.\n\nWithin retail trade, employment declined in electronic and appliance stores (-9,000) \nin September. Employment in wholesale trade, transportation and warehousing, financial \nactivities, and leisure and hospitality changed little.\n\nGovernment employment continued to trend down over the month (-34,000). The U.S. \nPostal Service continued to lose jobs (-5,000). Local government employment declined \nby 35,000 and has fallen by 535,000 since September 2008.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged up by 0.1 \nhour over the month to 34.3 hours following a decrease of 0.1 hour in August.

The average workweek for production and\nnonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged up by 0.1 hour to 33.6 hours \nin September. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn September, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls \nincreased by 4 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $23.12. This increase followed a decline of \n4 cents in August. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by \n1.9 percent. In September, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and\nnonsupervisory employees increased by 3 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $19.52. (See tables \nB-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for July was revised from +85,000 to \n+127,000, and the change for August was revised from 0 to +57,000.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for October is scheduled to be released on Friday, November 4, \n2011, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).\n\n\n\n",

Job gains occurred in health care, retail trade, manufacturing, \nand mining. Government employment continued to trend down.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe number of unemployed persons (13.9 million) and the unemployment rate (9.1 \npercent) changed little in July. Since April, the unemployment rate has shown \nlittle definitive movement. The labor force, at 153.2 million, was little \nchanged in July. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men(9.0 percent), \nadult women (7.9 percent), teenagers (25.0 percent), whites (8.1 percent), \nblacks (15.9 percent), and Hispanics (11.3 percent) showed little or no change \nin July. The jobless rate for Asians was 7.7 percent, not seasonally adjusted. \n(See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of persons unemployed for less than 5 weeks declined by 387,000 in \nJuly, mostly offsetting an increase in the prior month. The number of long-term \nunemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over), at 6.2 million, changed little \nover the month and accounted for 44.4 percent of the unemployed. (See \ntable A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate edged down in July to 63.9 percent, \nand the employment-population ratio was little changed at 58.1 percent. (See \ntable A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred \nto as involuntary part-time workers) was about unchanged in July at 8.4 million. \nThese individuals were working part time because their hours had been cut back \nor because they were unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn July, 2.8 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, little \nchanged from a year earlier. (These data are not seasonally adjusted.) These \nindividuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work,\nand had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted \nas unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding \nthe survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 1.1 million discouraged workers in \nJuly, about the same as a year earlier. (These data are not seasonally \nadjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work \nbecause they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.7 million \npersons marginally attached to the labor force in July had not searched for \nwork in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance \nor family responsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 117,000 in July, following little \ngrowth over the prior 2 months. Total private employment rose by 154,000 over \nthe month, reflecting job gains in several major industries, including health \ncare, retail trade, manufacturing, and mining. Government employment continued \nto decline. (See table B-1.)\n\nHealth care employment grew by 31,000 in July. Ambulatory health care services \nand hospitals each added 14,000 jobs over the month. Over the past 12 months, \nhealth care employment has grown by 299,000.\n\nRetail trade added 26,000 jobs in July. Employment in health and personal care \nstores rose by 9,000 over the month with small increases distributed among \nseveral other retail industries. Employment in retail trade has increased by \n228,000 since a recent low in December 2009.\n\nManufacturing employment increased in July (+24,000); nearly all of the \nincrease was in durable goods manufacturing. Within durable goods, the motor \nvehicles and parts industry had fewer seasonal layoffs than typical for July, \ncontributing to a seasonally adjusted employment increase of 12,000. \nManufacturing has added 289,000 jobs since its most recent trough in December \n2009, and durable goods manufacturing added 327,000 jobs during this period.\n\nIn July, employment in mining rose by 9,000; virtually all of the gain (+8,000) \noccurred in support activities for mining. Employment in mining has increased \nby 140,000 since a recent low in October 2009.\n\nEmployment in professional and technical services continued to trend up in July \n(+18,000). This industry has added 246,000 jobs since a recent low in March \n2010.

Job gains occurred in manufacturing, construction, professional and\nbusiness services, health care, and transportation and warehousing.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe number of unemployed persons (13.7 million) and the unemployment rate (8.9\npercent) changed little in February. The labor force was about unchanged over\nthe month. The jobless rate was down by 0.9 percentage point since November 2010.\n(See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (8.7 percent),\nadult women (8.0 percent), teenagers (23.9 percent), whites (8.0 percent), blacks\n(15.3 percent), and Hispanics (11.6 percent) showed little or no change in February.\nThe jobless rate for Asians was 6.8 percent, not seasonally adjusted. (See tables\nA-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs, at 8.3 million,\ncontinued to trend down in February and has fallen by 1.2 million over the past 12\nmonths. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more)\nwas 6.0 million and accounted for 43.9 percent of the unemployed. (See tables A-11\nand A-12.)\n\nBoth the civilian labor force participation rate, at 64.2 percent, and the employ-\nment-population ratio, at 58.4 percent, were unchanged in February. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred\nto as involuntary part-time workers) was essentially unchanged at 8.3 million in\nFebruary. These individuals were working part time because their hours had been cut\nback or because they were unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn February, 2.7 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, up\nfrom 2.5 million a year earlier. (These data are not seasonally adjusted.) These\nindividuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and\nhad looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as\nunemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the\nsurvey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 1.0 million discouraged workers in February,\na decrease of 184,000 from a year earlier. (These data are not seasonally adjusted.)\nDiscouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no\njobs are available for them. The remaining 1.7 million persons marginally attached to\nthe labor force in February had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the sur-\nvey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment rose by 192,000 in February. Job gains occurred in\nmanufacturing, construction, and several service-providing industries. Since a recent\nlow in February 2010, total payroll employment has grown by 1.3 million, or an average\nof 106,000 per month. (See table B-1.)\n\nManufacturing employment rose by 33,000 in February. Almost all of the gain occurred\nin durable goods industries, including machinery (+9,000) and fabricated metal pro-\nducts (+7,000). Manufacturing has added 195,000 jobs since its most recent trough in\nDecember 2009; durable goods manufacturing added 233,000 jobs during this period.\n\nConstruction employment grew by 33,000 in February, following a decline of 22,000 in\nJanuary that may have reflected severe winter weather. Within construction, specialty\ntrade contractors accounted for the bulk of the February job gain (+28,000).\n\nEmployment in the service-providing sector continued to expand in February, led by\na gain of 47,000 in professional and business services. Employment services added\n29,000 jobs, and employment rose by 7,000 in management and technical consulting.\nWithin employment services, the number of jobs in temporary help services edged up\nover the month.\n\nHealth care employment continued to increase in February (+34,000). Over the prior\n12 months, health care had added 260,000 jobs, or an average of 22,000 jobs per month.\n\nTransportation and warehousing employment increased by 22,000 in February, with half\nof that gain in truck transportation (+11,000).\n\nEmployment in both state and local government edged down over the month. Local govern-\nment has lost 377,000 jobs since its peak in September 2008.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at\n34.2 hours in February. The manufacturing workweek for all employees rose by 0.1 hour\nto 40.5 hours, while factory overtime rose by 0.2 hour to 3.3 hours. The average work-\nweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased\nby 0.1 hour to 33.5 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn February, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls\nincreased by 1 cent to $22.87. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have\nincreased by 1.7 percent. In February, average hourly earnings of private-sector pro-\nduction and nonsupervisory employees were unchanged at $19.33. (See tables B-3 and\nB-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for December was revised from +121,000\nto +152,000, and the change for January was revised from +36,000 to +63,000.\n\n___________\nThe Employment Situation for March is scheduled to be released on Friday, April 1, 2011,\nat 8:30 a.m. (EDT).\n\n\n\n",

In addition, establishment  |\n   |survey data have been revised as a result of the annual bench-  |\n   |marking process and the updating of seasonal adjustment factors.|\n   |Also, household survey data for January 2011 reflect updated    |\n   |population estimates. See the notes at the end of the news      |\n   |release for more information about these changes.               |\n   |________________________________________________________________|   \n   \n   \nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe unemployment rate (9.0 percent) declined by 0.4 percentage point\nfor the second month in a row. (See table A-1.) The number of\nunemployed persons decreased by about 600,000 in January to 13.9\nmillion, while the labor force was unchanged. (Based on data adjusted\nfor updated population controls. See table C.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men\n(8.8 percent), whites (8.0 percent), and Hispanics (11.9 percent)\ndeclined in January. The unemployment rates for adult women (7.9\npercent), teenagers (25.7 percent), and blacks (15.7 percent) were\nlittle changed. The jobless rate for Asians was 6.9 percent, not\nseasonally adjusted. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs fell\nfrom 8.9 to 8.5 million in January. The number of long-term unemployed\n(those jobless for 27 weeks or more) edged down to 6.2 million and\naccounted for 43.8 percent of the unemployed. (See tables A-11 and A-\n12.)\n\nAfter accounting for the annual adjustment to the population controls,\nthe employment-population ratio (58.4 percent) rose in January, and\nthe labor force participation rate (64.2 percent) was unchanged. (See\ntables A-1 and C.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons\n(sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) declined\nfrom 8.9 to 8.4 million in January. These individuals were working\npart time because their hours had been cut back or because they were\nunable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nIn January, 2.8 million persons were marginally attached to the labor\nforce, up from 2.5 million a year earlier. (These data are not\nseasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force,\nwanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime\nin the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because\nthey had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.\n(See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 1.0 million discouraged\nworkers in January, about the same as a year earlier. (These data are\nnot seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not\ncurrently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available\nfor them. The remaining 1.8 million persons marginally attached to the\nlabor force had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the\nsurvey for reasons such as school attendance or family\nresponsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment changed little in January (+36,000).\nManufacturing and retail trade added jobs over the month, while\nemployment declined in construction and in transportation and\nwarehousing. Since a recent low in February 2010, total payroll\nemployment has increased by an average of 93,000 per month. (See table\nB-1.)\n\nManufacturing added 49,000 jobs in January. Over the month, job gains\noccurred in durable goods, including motor vehicles and parts\n(+20,000), fabricated metal products (+13,000), machinery (+10,000),\nand computer and electronic products (+5,000). Employment in\nnondurable goods manufacturing declined by 13,000 over the month.\n\nEmployment in retail trade rose by 28,000 in January, after changing\nlittle in December. Retail trade has added 123,000 jobs since its\nrecent low point in December 2009. In January, employment in clothing\nstores increased by 15,000.\n\nHealth care employment continued to trend up over the month (+11,000).\nOver the prior 12 months, health care had added an average of 22,000\njobs per month.\n\nIn January, construction employment declined by 32,000. Within\nconstruction, there were job losses among nonresidential specialty\ntrade contractors (-22,000) and in construction of buildings \n(-10,000). Employment in construction may have been impacted by severe\nwinter weather affecting parts of the country during the survey\nreference period. (See the Frequently Asked Questions.)\n\nTransportation and warehousing employment fell by 38,000 in January,\nreflecting a sharp decline among couriers and messengers (-45,000).\nCouriers and messengers had an unusually large job gain in December,\nfollowed by layoffs of a similar magnitude in January.\n\nWithin professional and business services, employment in temporary\nhelp services was little changed in January (-11,000).  Temporary help\nhad added an average of 25,000 jobs per month over the prior 12\nmonths.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls\nfell by 0.1 hour to 34.2 hours in January. The manufacturing workweek\nfor all employees rose by 0.1 hour to 40.5 hours, while factory\novertime remained at 3.1 hours. The average workweek for production\nand nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls declined by\n0.1 hour to 33.4 hours; the workweek fell by 1.0 hour in construction,\nlikely reflecting severe winter weather. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn January, average hourly earnings for all employees on private\nnonfarm payrolls increased by 8 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $22.86. Over\nthe past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by\n1.9 percent. In January, average hourly earnings of private-sector\nproduction and nonsupervisory employees rose by 10 cents, or 0.5\npercent, to $19.34. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for November was\nrevised from +71,000 to +93,000, and the change for December was\nrevised from +103,000 to +121,000. Monthly revisions result from\nadditional sample reports and the monthly recalculation of seasonal\nfactors. The annual benchmark process also contributed to these\nrevisions.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for February is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, March 4, 2011, at 8:30 a.m. (EST). \n\n\n    ___________________________________________________________________________\n   |                                                                           |\n   |                  Changes to Household Survey Data                         |\n   |                                                                           |\n   |Effective with this release, two additional data series--\"Self-employed    |\n   |workers, unincorporated\" and \"Self-employed workers, incorporated\"--have   |\n   |been added to table A-9.                                                   |\n   |                                                                           |\n   |Also, in table A-8, the data series currently labeled \"Self-employed work- |\n   |ers\" (one for Agriculture and related industries and one for Nonagricul-   |\n   |tural industries) have been renamed \"Self-employed workers, unincorpor-    |\n   |ated.\" This is strictly a change in title and not in definition; the data  |\n   |shown were not be affected.

Population estimates for the household survey are devel-\n oped by the U.S. Census Bureau. Each year, the Census Bureau updates the estimates\n to reflect new information and assumptions about the growth of the population\n during the decade. The change in population reflected in the new estimates results\n from adjustments for net international migration, updated vital statistics and\n other information, and some methodological changes in the estimation process.\n \n The population control adjustments introduced with household survey data for \n January 2011 were applied to the population base determined by Census 2000. The\n results from Census 2010 will not be incorporated into the household survey pop-\n ulation controls until the release of data for January 2012.\n \n In accordance with usual practice, BLS will not revise the official household\n survey estimates for December 2010 and earlier months. To show the impact of the\n population adjustment, however, differences in selected December 2010 labor force\n series based on the old and new population estimates are shown in table B. The\n adjustment decreased the estimated size of the civilian noninstitutional population\n in December by 347,000, the civilian labor force by 504,000, and employment by\n 472,000; the new population estimates had a negligible impact on unemployment rates\n and most other percentage estimates. Data users are cautioned that these annual pop-\n ulation adjustments affect the comparability of household data series over time.\n Estimates of large levels, such as total labor force and employment, are impacted\n most. Table C shows the effect of the introduction of new population estimates on\n the changes in selected labor force measures between December 2010 and January 2011.\n Additional information on the population adjustments and their effect on national\n labor force estimates are available at www.bls.gov/cps/cps11adj.pdf. \n \n \n \n Table B.

Seasonally adjusted estimates back to January 2006 were|\n   |subject to revision. The unemployment rates for January 2010 through  |\n   |November 2010 (as originally published and as revised) appear in      |\n   |table A, along with additional information about the revisions.       |\n   |______________________________________________________________________|\n\n\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe number of unemployed persons decreased by 556,000 to 14.5 million\nin December, and the unemployment rate dropped to 9.4 percent. Over\nthe year, these measures were down from 15.2 million and 9.9 percent,\nrespectively. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men\n(9.4 percent) and whites (8.5 percent) declined in December. The un-\nemployment rates for adult women (8.1 percent), teenagers (25.4 per-\ncent), blacks (15.8 percent), and Hispanics (13.0 percent) showed\nlittle change. The jobless rate for Asians was 7.2 percent, not\nseasonally adjusted. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nIn December, the number of job losers and persons who completed tem-\nporary jobs dropped by 548,000 to 8.9 million. The number of long-\nterm unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little\nchanged at 6.4 million and accounted for 44.3 percent of the unem-\nployed. (See tables A-11 and A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate edged down in December to\n64.3 percent, and the employment-population ratio was essentially un-\nchanged at 58.3 percent. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (some-\ntimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) was essentially \nunchanged in December at 8.9 million. These individuals were working \npart time because their hours had been cut back or because they were \nunable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nAbout 2.6 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force\nin December, little different than a year earlier. (The data are not\nseasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force,\nwanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime\nin the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because\nthey had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.\n(See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 1.3 million discouraged\nworkers in December, an increase of 389,000 from December 2009. (The\ndata are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons\nnot currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are\navailable for them. The remaining 1.3 million persons marginally\nattached to the labor force had not searched for work in the 4 weeks\npreceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family\nresponsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 103,000 in December.\nEmployment rose in leisure and hospitality and in health care but\nchanged little in other major industries. Since December 2009, total\npayroll employment has increased by 1.1 million, or an average of\n94,000 per month. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality increased by 47,000 in December.\nWithin the industry, job gains continued in food services and drinking\nplaces (+25,000). Since a recent low in December 2009, the food services \nindustry has added 188,000 jobs.\n\nIn December, health care employment continued to expand, with a gain\nof 36,000. Over the month, job gains continued in ambulatory services\n(+21,000), hospitals (+8,000), and nursing and residential care facili-\nties (+7,000). \n\nWithin professional and business services, employment in temporary help \nservices continued to trend up in December (+16,000) and has risen by \n495,000 since a recent low in September 2009.\n\nEmployment in retail trade changed little in December (+12,000). A \njob gain in motor vehicle and parts dealers (+8,000) offset a loss \nin health and personal care stores (-8,000). Employment in most other\nservice-providing industries changed little over the month.\n\nIn the goods-producing sector, mining employment continued to trend \nup in December, reflecting a job gain in support activities for mining\n(+5,000).\n\nManufacturing employment changed little over the month (+10,000). Fol-\nlowing job growth earlier in 2010, employment has been relatively flat, \non net, since May. Construction employment also was little changed overall \nin December (-16,000). Within construction, there were job losses in heavy \nand civil engineering (-13,000) and in residential building (-6,000).\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls\nheld at 34.3 hours in December. The manufacturing workweek for all\nemployees declined by 0.1 hour to 40.2 hours, while factory overtime\nremained at 3.1 hours. The average workweek for production and non-\nsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.1\nhour to 33.6 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn December, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm \npayrolls increased by 3 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $22.78. Over the past 12 \nmonths, average hourly earnings have increased by 1.8 percent. In December, \naverage hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory em-\nployees rose by 2 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $19.21. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for October was revised\nfrom +172,000 to +210,000, and the change for November was revised\nfrom +39,000 to +71,000.\n\n\n_________\nThe Employment Situation for January is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, February 4, 2011, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n\n    __________________________________________________________________________\n   |                                                                          |\n   |               Upcoming Changes to Establishment Survey Data              |\n   |                                                                          |\n   |Effective with the release of January 2011 data on February 4, 2011, the  |\n   |establishment survey will begin estimating net business birth/death ad-   |\n   |justment factors on a quarterly basis, replacing the current practice of  |\n   |estimating the factors annually.

Temporary help services and health care continued to add jobs\nover the month, while employment fell in retail trade. Employment in most major\nindustries changed little in November.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe number of unemployed persons was 15.1 million in November. The unemployment\nrate edged up to 9.8 percent; it was 9.6 percent in each of the prior 3 months.\n(See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (10.0 per-\ncent), adult women (8.4 percent), whites (8.9 percent), and Hispanics (13.2 per-\ncent) edged up in November. The jobless rate for blacks (16.0 percent) showed\nlittle change over the month, while the rate for teenagers declined to 24.6 per-\ncent. The jobless rate for Asians was 7.6 percent, not seasonally adjusted. (See\ntables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of job losers and persons who completed tempor-\nary jobs rose by 390,000 to 9.5 million in November. The number of long-term un-\nemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over) was little changed at 6.3 million\nand accounted for 41.9 percent of the unemployed. (See tables A-11 and A-12.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate held at 64.5 percent in November, and\nthe employment-population ratio was essentially unchanged at 58.2 percent. (See\ntable A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred\nto as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed over the month at 9.0 mil-\nlion. These individuals were working part time because their hours had been cut\nback or because they were unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nAbout 2.5 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force in November,\nup from 2.3 million a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These\nindividuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and\nhad looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as un-\nemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the sur-\nvey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 1.3 million discouraged workers in\nNovember, an increase of 421,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not season-\nally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work \nbecause they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.2 million\npersons marginally attached to the labor force had not searched for work in the\n4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family\nresponsibilities. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment changed little in November (+39,000). Job gains\ncontinued in temporary help services and in health care, while employment fell in\nretail trade. Since December 2009, total payroll employment has increased by an \naverage of 86,000 per month. (See table B-1.)\n\nWithin professional and business services, employment in temporary help services\ncontinued to increase in November (+40,000) and has risen by 494,000 since Septem-\nber 2009.\n\nHealth care continued to add jobs over the month, with a gain of 19,000. Much of\nthe increase occurred in hospitals (+8,000).\n\nEmployment in mining continued to trend up over the month. Support activities for\nmining added 6,000 jobs in November and has added 74,000 jobs since October 2009.\n\nRetail trade employment fell by 28,000 in November. Job losses occurred in depart-\nment stores (-9,000) and in furniture and home furnishings stores (-5,000).\n\nEmployment in manufacturing was little changed over the month (-13,000). Following\njob growth earlier in 2010, employment has been relatively flat, on net, since May.\nEmployment in most other major industries changed little in November.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls held at 34.3\nhours in November. The manufacturing workweek for all employees also was unchanged,\nat 40.3 hours, and factory overtime remained at 3.1 hours. The average workweek for\nproduction and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased by\n0.1 hour to 33.5 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn November, average hourly earnings of all employees on private nonfarm payrolls\nincreased by 1 cent to $22.75. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings\nhave increased by 1.6 percent. In November, average hourly earnings of private-sec-\ntor production and nonsupervisory employees were unchanged at $19.19. (See tables\nB-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for September was revised from -41,000\nto -24,000, and the change for October was revised from +151,000 to +172,000.\n\n-----------\nThe Employment Situation for December is scheduled to be released on Friday,\nJanuary 7, 2011, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n    __________________________________________________________________________\n   |                                                                          |\n   |           Revision of Seasonally Adjusted Household Survey Data          |\n   |                                                                          |\n   |In accordance with usual practice, The Employment Situation release for   |\n   |December 2010, scheduled for January 7, 2011, will incorporate annual     |\n   |revisions in seasonally adjusted unemployment and   other  labor  force   |\n   |series from the household survey.

Since December 2009, nonfarm payroll\nemployment has risen by 874,000.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe number of unemployed persons, at 14.8 million, was little changed\nin October. The unemployment rate remained at 9.6 percent and has\nbeen essentially unchanged since May. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for adult men\n(9.7 percent), adult women (8.1 percent), teenagers (27.1 percent),\nwhites (8.8 percent), blacks (15.7 percent), and Hispanics (12.6 per-\ncent) showed little change in October. The jobless rate for Asians was \n7.1 percent, not seasonally adjusted. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and\nover) was about unchanged over the month at 6.2 million. In October,\n41.8 percent of unemployed persons had been jobless for 27 weeks or\nmore. (See table A-12.)\n\nBoth the civilian labor force participation rate, at 64.5 percent, and\nthe employment-population ratio, at 58.3 percent, edged down over the\nmonth. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (some-\ntimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) fell by 318,000 \nover the month to 9.2 million, partially offsetting large increases in \nthe prior 2 months. These individuals were working part time because \ntheir hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a \nfull-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nAbout 2.6 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force\nin October, up from 2.4 million a year earlier. (The data are not sea-\nsonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, want-\ned and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in \nthe prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they \nhad not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. \n(See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 1.2 million discouraged\nworkers in October, an increase of 411,000 from a year earlier. (The\ndata are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not\ncurrently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available\nfor them. The remaining 1.4 million persons marginally attached to\nthe labor force had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the\nsurvey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities. \n(See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment increased by 151,000 in October, re-\nflecting job gains in mining and a number of service-providing indus-\ntries. Private-sector payroll employment rose by 159,000 over the \nmonth; since December 2009, employment in the private sector has risen \nby 1.1 million. (See table B-1.)\n\nWithin professional and business services, employment in temporary\nhelp services continued to increase in October, with a gain of 35,000.\nTemporary help services has added 451,000 jobs since a recent low in\nSeptember 2009. Employment in computer systems design and related ser-\nvices increased by 8,000 in October and has risen by 53,000 since a \nrecent low in June 2009.\n\nHealth care continued to add jobs in October (+24,000). The gain was\nin line with the average increase over the prior 12 months (+20,000).\n\nRetail trade employment rose by 28,000 in October, including increases\nin automobile dealers (+6,000) and in electronics and appliance stores\n(+5,000). After reaching a trough in December 2009, employment in re-\ntail trade has expanded by 128,000.\n\nWithin leisure and hospitality, a job loss in arts, entertainment, and\nrecreation (-26,000) in October offset a gain in food services and \ndrinking places employment (+24,000). The food services industry has \nadded 143,000 jobs since a recent low in December 2009.\n\nMining employment continued to trend up (+8,000) over the month. Since\na recent low in October 2009, mining has added 88,000 jobs.\n\nEmployment in manufacturing changed little in October (-7,000) and, on\nnet, has essentially been flat since May.

The manufacturing\nworkweek for all employees also increased by 0.1 hour, to 40.3 hours,\nwhile factory overtime was unchanged at 3.0 hours. The average work-\nweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm \npayrolls increased by 0.1 hour to 33.6 hours in October. \n(See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn October, average hourly earnings of all employees on private non-\nfarm payrolls increased by 5 cents to $22.73.

Government employment declined (-159,000), reflec-\nting both a drop in the number of temporary jobs for Census 2010 and job \nlosses in local government. Private-sector payroll employment continued \nto trend up modestly (+64,000).\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe number of unemployed persons, at 14.8 million, was essentially un-\nchanged in September, and the unemployment rate held at 9.6 percent. (See \ntable A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for adult men (9.8 \npercent), adult women (8.0 percent), teenagers (26.0 percent), whites \n(8.7 percent), blacks (16.1 percent), and Hispanics (12.4 percent) showed \nlittle or no change in September. The jobless rate for Asians was 6.4 \npercent, not seasonally adjusted. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over), \nat 6.1 million, was little changed over the month but was down by 640,000 \nsince a series high of 6.8 million in May. In September, 41.7 percent \nof unemployed persons had been jobless for 27 weeks or more. (See table \nA-12.)\n\nIn September, both the civilian labor force participation rate, at 64.7 \npercent, and the employment-population ratio, at 58.5 percent, were un-\nchanged. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes \nreferred to as involuntary part-time workers) rose by 612,000 over the \nmonth to 9.5 million. Over the past 2 months, the number of such workers \nhas increased by 943,000. These individuals were working part time be-\ncause their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find \na full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nAbout 2.5 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force \nin September, up from 2.2 million a year earlier. (The data are not sea-\nsonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted \nand were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the \nprior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had \nnot searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table \nA-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 1.2 million discouraged work-\ners in September, an increase of 503,000 from a year earlier. (The data \nare not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not cur-\nrently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for \nthem. The remaining 1.3 million persons marginally attached to the labor \nforce had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey \nfor reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities. (See \ntable A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment edged down by 95,000 in September.\nGovernment employment fell by 159,000, reflecting both the departure\nof 77,000 temporary Census 2010 workers from federal government pay-\nrolls and a decline of 76,000 in local government employment. Private-\nsector payroll employment continued to trend up (+64,000) over the \nmonth. (See table B-1.)\n\nHealth care employment rose by 24,000 in September. The increase was\nconcentrated in ambulatory health care services (+17,000). Health care\nemployment has risen by an average of 21,000 per month this year.\n\nWithin professional and business services, employment services added\n28,000 jobs in September. Temporary help services accounted for most\nof the gain.\n\nWithin leisure and hospitality, employment in food services and drink-\ning places increased by 34,000 over the month and has risen by 104,000 \nthus far in 2010.\n\nMining employment continued to trend up (+6,000) over the month. Mining \nhas added 77,000 jobs since a recent low in October 2009.\n\nEmployment in manufacturing changed little in September and, on net, has \nbeen essentially flat since May. The industry added 134,000 jobs during \nthe first 5 months of the year.\n\nEmployment in wholesale trade, retail trade, transportation and ware-\nhousing, information, and financial activities showed little change in \nSeptember.\n\nEmployment in construction edged down (-21,000) over the month, partly\noffsetting an employment gain in August. Both the August and September\nchanges were concentrated among nonresidential specialty trade contrac-\ntors. Construction employment has shown little net change since February.\n\nGovernment employment fell by 159,000 in September. A decline in federal \ngovernment employment was due to the loss of 77,000 temporary Census 2010 \njobs. As of September, about 6,000 temporary decennial census workers re-\nmained on the federal government payroll, down from a peak of 564,000 in \nMay. Employment in local government decreased by 76,000 in September with \njob losses in both education and noneducation.\n\nIn September, the average workweek for all employees was unchanged at 34.2 \nhours. The manufacturing workweek for all employees decreased by 0.1 hour \nto 40.1 hours, and factory overtime was unchanged at 3.0 hours. The aver-\nage workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private non-\nfarm payrolls was unchanged at 33.5 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nAverage hourly earnings of all employees on private nonfarm payrolls in-\ncreased by 1 cent to $22.67 in September. Over the past 12 months, aver-\nage hourly earnings have increased by 1.7 percent. In September, average \nhourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employ-\nees increased by 1 cent to $19.10.  (See tables B-3 and B-8.) \n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for July was revised from \n-54,000 to -66,000, and the change for August was revised from -54,000 to \n-57,000.\n\n\n____________\nThe Employment Situation for October is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, November 5, 2010, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).\n\n\n\n      -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n     |                                                                       |\n     |             Preliminary Estimates of Benchmark Revisions              |\n     |                      to the Establishment Survey                      |\n     |                                                                       |\n     | In accordance with usual practice, the Bureau of Labor Statistics     |\n     | is announcing its preliminary estimates of the upcoming annual bench- |\n     | mark revision to the establishment survey employment series.

Government employment fell, as 114,000 temporary\nworkers hired for the decennial census completed their work. Private-sector\npayroll employment continued to trend up modestly (+67,000).\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nThe number of unemployed persons (14.9 million) and the unemployment rate\n(9.6 percent) were little changed in August. From May through August, the\njobless rate remained in the range of 9.5 to 9.7 percent. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for adult men (9.8 per-\ncent), adult women (8.0 percent), teenagers (26.3 percent), whites (8.7 per-\ncent), blacks (16.3 percent), and Hispanics (12.0 percent) showed little\nchange in August. The jobless rate for Asians was 7.2 percent, not season-\nally adjusted. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over) de-\nclined by 323,000 over the month to 6.2 million. In August, 42.0 percent of\nunemployed persons had been jobless for 27 weeks or more. (See table A-12.)\n\nIn August, the civilian labor force participation rate (64.7 percent) and\nthe employment-population ratio (58.5 percent) were essentially unchanged.\n(See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes re-\nferred to as involuntary part-time workers) increased by 331,000 over the\nmonth to 8.9 million. These individuals were working part time because their\nhours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job.\n(See table A-8.)\n\nAbout 2.4 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force in\nAugust, little changed from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally ad-\njusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were avail-\nable for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They\nwere not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the\n4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 1.1 million discouraged workers in\nAugust, an increase of 352,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not season-\nally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work\nbecause they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.3 million\npersons marginally attached to the labor force had not searched for work in the\n4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family\nresponsibilities.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment was little changed (-54,000) in August. Govern-\nment employment fell by 121,000, reflecting the departure of 114,000 temporary\nCensus 2010 workers from federal government payrolls. Total private employment\ncontinued to trend up modestly over the month (+67,000). Since its most recent\nlow in December 2009, private-sector employment has risen by 763,000. (See\ntable B-1.)\n\nEmployment in health care increased by 28,000 in August, with the largest gains\noccurring in ambulatory health care services (+17,000) and hospitals (+9,000).\nThus far in 2010, the health care industry has added an average of 20,000 jobs\nper month, about in line with the average monthly job growth in 2009.\n\nMining employment rose by 8,000 in August. Since a recent low in October 2009,\nemployment in the industry has increased by 72,000. Support activities for mining\nhas accounted for about three-fourths of the gain.\n\nManufacturing employment declined by 27,000 over the month. A decline in motor\nvehicles and parts (-22,000) offset a gain of similar magnitude in July as the\nindustry departed somewhat from its usual layoff and recall pattern for annual\nretooling.\n\nWithin professional and business services, employment in temporary help services\nwas up by 17,000. This industry has added 392,000 jobs since a recent employment\nlow in September 2009.\n\nConstruction employment was up (+19,000) in August. This change partially re-\nflected the return to payrolls of 10,000 workers who were on strike in July.\n\nEmployment in retail trade was about unchanged over the month. A job gain among\nmotor vehicle and parts dealers (+8,000) was essentially offset by losses in\nbuilding materials and garden supply stores (-6,000).\n\nEmployment in other private-sector industries, including wholesale trade, trans-\nportation and warehousing, information, financial activities, and leisure and\nhospitality, showed little change in August.\n\nOver the month, government employment fell by 121,000, largely reflecting the\nloss of 114,000 temporary workers hired for Census 2010. The number of tempor-\nary Census 2010 workers peaked in May at 564,000 but has declined to 82,000 in\nAugust.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged\nover the month at 34.2 hours. The manufacturing workweek for all employees in-\ncreased by 0.1 hour to 40.2 hours, and factory overtime was up by 0.1 hour. The\naverage workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm\npayrolls increased by 0.1 hour to 33.5 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nAverage hourly earnings of all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased\nby 6 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $22.66 in August. Over the past 12 months, aver-\nage hourly earnings have increased by 1.7 percent. In August, average hourly\nearnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees increased by\n3 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $19.08.

(The data are not seasonally adjusted.)\nDiscouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they be-\nlieve no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.3 million persons margin-\nally attached to the labor force had not searched for work in the 4 weeks pre-\nceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibili-\nties. (See table A-16.)\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nIn March, nonfarm payroll employment rose by 162,000. Job growth continued in tem-\nporary help services and in health care. Federal government employment increased\ndue to the hiring of temporary workers for Census 2010. Job losses continued in \nfinancial activities and in information. (See table B-1.)\n\nTemporary help services added 40,000 jobs in March. Since September 2009, tempor-\nary help services employment has risen by 313,000.\n\nEmployment in health care continued to increase in March (27,000), with the larg-\nest gains occurring in ambulatory health care services (16,000) and in nursing and\nresidential care facilities (9,000).\n\nIn March, employment in mining increased by 8,000. Monthly job gains in mining\nhave averaged 6,000 over the past 5 months.\n\nEmployment in federal government was up over the month, reflecting the hiring of\n48,000 temporary workers for the decennial census.\n\nManufacturing employment continued to trend up in March (17,000); the industry has\nadded 45,000 jobs in the first 3 months of 2010. Over the month, job gains were \nconcentrated in fabricated metal products (9,000) and in machinery (6,000).\n\nEmployment in construction held steady (15,000) in March. The industry had lost an\naverage of 72,000 jobs per month in the prior 12 months.\n\nOver the month, employment changed little in transportation and warehousing,\nleisure and hospitality, retail trade, and wholesale trade.\n\nIn March, financial activities shed 21,000 jobs, with the largest losses occur-\nring in insurance carriers and related activities (-9,000). Employment in the\ninformation industry decreased by 12,000.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was up by\n0.1 hour to 34.0 hours in March. The manufacturing workweek for all employees\nincreased by 0.2 hour to 39.9 hours, and factory overtime was up by 0.1 hour\nover the month. In March, the average workweek for production and nonsuper-\nvisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.2 hour to 33.3\nhours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn March, average hourly earnings of all employees on private nonfarm payrolls\nfell by 2 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $22.47, following a 4-cent gain in February.\nOver the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen by 1.8 percent. In\nMarch, average hourly earnings of private production and nonsupervisory employ-\nees fell by 2 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $18.90. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for January was revised from\n-26,000 to +14,000, and the change for February was revised from -36,000 to\n-14,000.\n\n____________\nThe Employment Situation for April is scheduled to be released on Friday,\nMay 7, 2010, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).\n\n\n\n",

Employment fell in construction and information, while tem-\nporary help services added jobs. Severe winter weather in parts of the\ncountry may have affected payroll employment and hours; however, it is not\npossible to quantify precisely the net impact of the winter storms on these\nmeasures. For more information on the effects of the severe weather on employ-\nment estimates, see the box note at the end of the release.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn February, the number of unemployed persons, at 14.9 million, was essen-\ntially unchanged, and the unemployment rate remained at 9.7 percent. (See\ntable A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (10.0 per-\ncent), adult women (8.0 percent), whites (8.8 percent), blacks (15.8 percent),\nHispanics (12.4 percent), and teenagers (25.0 percent) showed little to no\nchange in February. The jobless rate for Asians was 8.4 percent, not season-\nally adjusted. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over) was\n6.1 million in February and has been about that level since December. About 4\nin 10 unemployed persons have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more. (See\ntable A-12.)\n\nIn February, the civilian labor force participation rate (64.8 percent) and\nthe employment-population ratio (58.5 percent) were little changed. (See\ntable A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons working part time for economic reasons (sometimes refer-\nred to as involuntary part-time workers) increased from 8.3 to 8.8 million in\nFebruary, partially offsetting a large decrease in the prior month. These in-\ndividuals were working part time because their hours had been cut back or be-\ncause they were unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-8.)\n\nAbout 2.5 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force in\nFebruary, an increase of 476,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not sea-\nsonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and\nwere available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12\nmonths. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for\nwork in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 1.2 million discouraged workers in\nFebruary, up by 473,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally ad-\njusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work be-\ncause they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.3 million\npersons marginally attached to the labor force had not searched for work in\nthe 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or\nfamily responsibilities.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment was little changed in February (-36,000).\nJob losses continued in construction and information, while employment con-\ntinued to increase in temporary help services. Since the start of the reces-\nsion in December 2007, payroll employment has fallen by 8.4 million. (See\ntable B-1.)\n\nConstruction employment fell by 64,000 in February, about in line with the\naverage monthly job loss over the prior 6 months. Job losses were concen-\ntrated in nonresidential building (-10,000) and among nonresidential specialty\ntrade contractors (-35,000). Since December 2007, employment in construction\nhas fallen by 1.9 million.\n\nEmployment in the information industry dropped by 18,000 in February. Since\nDecember 2007, job losses in information have totaled 297,000. In February,\nemployment in transportation and warehousing continued to trend down.\n\nEmployment in manufacturing was essentially unchanged in February. Small job\ngains in a number of component industries were offset by job losses in motor\nvehicles and parts and in chemicals.\n\nRetail trade employment was unchanged in February, after a sizeable increase\nin January. Over the month, job gains in building material and garden supply\nstores (7,000) and in department stores (6,000) were offset by declines in\nfood and beverage stores (-9,000).\n\nIn February, temporary help services added 48,000 jobs. Since reaching a low\npoint in September 2009, temporary help services employment has risen by\n284,000. Health care employment continued to trend upward in February.\n\nIn February, employment in the federal government edged up. The hiring of\n15,000 temporary workers for Census 2010 was partially offset by a decline\nin U.S. Postal Service employment.\n\nThe average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls declined\nby 0.1 hour to 33.8 hours in February. The manufacturing workweek for all\nemployees dropped by 0.4 hour to 39.5 hours, and factory overtime decreased\nby 0.2 hour over the month. In February, the average workweek for production\nor nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls fell by 0.2 hour to\n33.1 hours; the workweek fell by 1.0 hour in construction, likely reflecting\nthe unusually severe winter storms. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn February, average hourly earnings of all employees on private nonfarm\npayrolls increased by 3 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $22.46. Over the past 12\nmonths, average hourly earnings have risen by 1.9 percent. In February, aver-\nage hourly earnings of private production and nonsupervisory employees rose\nby 3 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $18.93. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for December was revised from\n-150,000 to -109,000, and the change for January was revised from -20,000 to\n-26,000.\n\n\nThe Employment Situation for March is scheduled to be released on Friday,\nApril 2, 2010, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).\n\n\n    _______________________________________________________________________\n   |                                                                       |\n   |         Effect of Severe Winter Storms on Employment Estimates        |\n   |                                                                       |\n   |Major winter storms affected parts of the country during the February  |\n   |reference periods for the establishment and household surveys.         |\n   |                                                                       |\n   |In the establishment survey, the reference period was the pay period   |\n   |including February 12th.

Employment fell in construction and in \ntransportation and warehousing, while temporary help services and retail \ntrade added jobs.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn January, the number of unemployed persons decreased to 14.8 million, \nand the unemployment rate fell by 0.3 percentage point to 9.7 percent. \n(See table A-1.)\n\nIn January, unemployment rates for most major worker groups--adult men\n(10.0 percent), teenagers (26.4 percent), blacks (16.5 percent), and \nHispanics (12.6 percent)--showed little change. The jobless rate for adult \nwomen fell to 7.9 percent, and the rate for whites declined to 8.7 percent. \nThe jobless rate for Asians was 8.4 percent, not seasonally adjusted. \n(See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThis release includes new household survey tables with information about \nemployment and unemployment of veterans, persons with a disability, and the \nforeign born. In January, the unemployment rate of veterans from Gulf War \nera II (September 2001 to the present) was 12.6 percent, compared with 10.4 \npercent for nonveterans. Persons with a disability had a higher jobless rate \nthan persons with no disability--15.2 versus 10.4 percent. In addition, the \nlabor force participation rate of persons with a disability was 21.8 percent, \ncompared with 70.1 percent for those without a disability.

Nearly all of this decline occurred among permanent \njob losers.  (See table A-11.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over) \ncontinued to trend up in January, reaching 6.3 million. Since the start of \nthe recession in December 2007, the number of long-term unemployed has risen \nby 5.0 million. (See table A-12.)\n\nIn January, the civilian labor force participation rate was little changed at \n64.7 percent. The employment-population ratio rose from 58.2 to 58.4 percent. \n(See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons who worked part time for economic reasons (sometimes \nreferred to as involuntary part-time workers) fell from 9.2 to 8.3 million \nin January. These individuals were working part time because their hours had \nbeen cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job. (See \ntable A-8.)\n\nAbout 2.5 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force in \nJanuary, an increase of 409,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not \nseasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted \nand were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior \n12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched \nfor work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-16.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 1.1 million discouraged workers in \nJanuary, up from 734,000 a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.)  \nDiscouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they \nbelieve no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.5 million people \nmarginally attached to the labor force had not searched for work in the 4 weeks \npreceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsi-\nbilities.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment was essentially unchanged in January (-20,000). \nJob losses continued in construction and in transportation and warehousing, \nwhile employment increased in temporary help services and retail trade. Since \nthe start of the recession in December 2007, payroll employment has fallen by \n8.4 million. Over the last 3 months, however, employment has shown little net \nchange. (See table B-1.)\n\nConstruction employment declined by 75,000 in January, with nonresidential \nspecialty trade contractors (-48,000) accounting for the majority of the de-\ncline. Since December 2007, employment in construction has fallen by 1.9 \nmillion.\n\nIn January, transportation and warehousing employment fell by 19,000, due to \na large job loss among couriers and messengers (-23,000).\n\nEmployment in manufacturing was little changed in January (11,000). After expe-\nriencing steep job losses earlier in the recession, employment declines \nmoderated considerably in the second half of 2009. In January, job gains in \nmotor vehicles and parts (23,000) and plastics and rubber products (6,000) \noffset small job losses elsewhere in the industry.\n\nIn January, temporary help services added 52,000 jobs. Since reaching a low \npoint in September 2009, temporary help services employment has risen by \n247,000.\n\nRetail trade employment rose by 42,000 in January, after showing little \nchange in the prior 2 months. Job gains occurred in January among food stores \n(14,000), clothing stores (13,000), and general merchandise retailers (10,000).\n\nHealth care employment continued to trend up in January. Ambulatory health \ncare services added 15,000 jobs over the month.\n\nIn January, the federal government added 33,000 jobs, including 9,000 tempo-\nrary positions for Census 2010. Employment in state and local governments, \nexcluding education, continued to trend down.\n\nThis release includes a new establishment survey table with information about \nwomen employees. In January, women made up 49.9 percent of total nonfarm pay-\nroll employment, compared with 48.8 percent when the recession began in \nDecember 2007. (See table B-5.)\n\nAlso new in this release are data on hours and earnings for all employees in \nthe private sector. The average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm \npayrolls was up by 0.1 hour to 33.9 hours in January. The manufacturing work-\nweek for all employees rose by 0.3 hour to 39.9 hours, and factory overtime \nincreased by 0.1 hour over the month. Since June, the manufacturing workweek \nhas increased by 1.2 hours. In January, the average workweek for production \nand nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 0.1 hour to \n33.3 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)\n\nIn January, average hourly earnings of all employees on private nonfarm pay-\nrolls increased by 4 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $22.45. Over the past 12 months, \naverage hourly earnings have risen by 2.0 percent. In January, average hourly \nearnings of private production and nonsupervisory employees rose by 5 cents, \nor 0.3 percent, to $18.89. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for November was revised from \n4,000 to 64,000, and the change for December was revised from -85,000 to \n-150,000. Monthly revisions result from additional sample reports and the \nmonthly recalculation of seasonal factors. The annual benchmark process also \ncontributed to these revisions.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for February is scheduled to be released on Friday, \nMarch 5, 2010, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n\n\n    ---------------------------------------------------------------\n   |                                                               |\n   |      Changes to The Employment Situation Text and Tables      |\n   |                                                               |\n   | Effective with this release, several changes to The Employ-   |\n   | ment Situation news release text and tables have been intro-  |\n   | duced.

In addition, with this release, the seasonally \nadjusted establishment survey data from January 2005 forward were subject to\nrevision due to the introduction of updated seasonal adjustment factors.\n\nTable A presents revised total nonfarm employment data on a seasonally adjust-\ned basis for January through December 2009. The revised data for April 2009 \nforward incorporate the effect of applying the rate of change measured by the \nsample to the new benchmark level, as well as updated net business birth/death \nmodel adjustments and new seasonal adjustment factors. The November and \nDecember 2009 revisions also reflect the routine incorporation of additional \nsample receipts into the November final and December second preliminary \nestimates. The total nonfarm employment level for March 2009 was revised down-\nward by 902,000 (930,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis), or 0.7 percent. The\npreviously published level for December 2009 was revised downward 1,390,000 \n(1,363,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis).\n\nAn article that discusses the benchmark and post-benchmark revisions, as well \nas all revised historical Current Employment Statistics (CES) data, can be \naccessed through the CES homepage at www.bls.gov/ces/. Information on the \nrevisions released today also may be obtained by calling (202) 691-6555.\n\n\n\n  Table A.

Population estimates for the household survey \nare developed by the U.S. Census Bureau. Each year, the Census Bureau updates \nthe estimates to reflect new information and assumptions about the growth of \nthe population during the decade. The change in population reflected in the \nnew estimates results primarily from adjustments for net international migra-\ntion, updated vital statistics and other information, and some methodological \nchanges in the estimation process.\n\nIn accordance with usual practice, BLS will not revise the official household\nsurvey estimates for December 2009 or earlier months. To show the impact of \nthe population adjustment, however, differences in selected December 2009 labor\nforce series based on the old and new population estimates are shown in table B. \nThe adjustment decreased the estimated size of the civilian noninstitutional \npopulation in December by 258,000, the civilian labor force by 249,000, and \nemployment by 243,000; the new population estimates had a negligible impact \non unemployment rates and other percentage estimates. Data users are cautioned \nthat these annual population adjustments affect the comparability of household \ndata series over time. Estimates of large levels, such as total labor force and \nemployment, are impacted most. Table C shows the effect of the introduction of \nnew population estimates on the changes in selected labor force measures between \nDecember 2009 and January 2010. More detailed information on the population \nadjustments and their effect on national labor force estimates are available at \nwww.bls.gov/cps/cps10adj.pdf.\n\n\n\nTable B.

Employment fell in construction, manufacturing, and\nwholesale trade, while temporary help services and health care added jobs.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn December, both the number of unemployed persons, at 15.3 million, and the\nunemployment rate, at 10.0 percent, were unchanged. At the start of the re-\ncession in December 2007, the number of unemployed persons was 7.7 million,\nand the unemployment rate was 5.0 percent. (See table A-1.)\n\n\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n   |                                                                      |\n   |         Revision of Seasonally Adjusted Household Survey Data        |\n   |                                                                      |\n   |Seasonally adjusted household survey data have been revised using up- |\n   |dated seasonal adjustment factors, a procedure done at the end of each|\n   |calendar year. Seasonally adjusted estimates back to January 2005 were|\n   |subject to revision. The unemployment rates for January 2009 through  |\n   |November 2009 (as originally published and as revised) appear in      |\n   |table B, along with additional information about the revisions.       |\n   |                                                                      |\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUnemployment rates for the major worker groups--adult men (10.2 percent),\nadult women (8.2 percent), teenagers (27.1 percent), whites (9.0 percent),\nblacks (16.2 percent), and Hispanics (12.9 percent)--showed little change in\nDecember. The unemployment rate for Asians was 8.4 percent, not seasonally\nadjusted. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27\nweeks and over) continued to trend up, reaching 6.1 million. In December, 4 in\n10 unemployed workers were jobless for 27 weeks or longer. (See table A-9.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate fell to 64.6 percent in December.\nThe employment-population ratio declined to 58.2 percent. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes re-\nferred to as involuntary part-time workers) was about unchanged at 9.2 million\nin December and has been relatively flat since March. These individuals were\nworking part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were\nunable to find a full-time job. (See table A-5.)\n\nAbout 2.5 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force in\nDecember, an increase of 578,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not sea-\nsonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and\nwere available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12\nmonths. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for\nwork in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-13.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 929,000 discouraged workers in\nDecember, up from 642,000 a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally ad-\njusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work be-\ncause they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.6 million\npersons marginally attached to the labor force had not searched for work in\nthe 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or\nfamily responsibilities.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment edged down in December (-85,000). Job losses\ncontinued in construction, manufacturing, and wholesale trade, while temporary\nhelp services and health care continued to add jobs. During 2009, monthly job\nlosses moderated substantially. Employment losses in the first quarter of 2009\naveraged 691,000 per month, compared with an average loss of 69,000 per month\nin the fourth quarter. (See table B-1.)\n\nConstruction employment declined by 53,000 in December, with job losses\nthroughout the industry. Employment in construction has fallen by 1.6 mil-\nlion since the recession began.\n\nIn December, employment in manufacturing decreased by 27,000. The average\nmonthly decline for the last 6 months of 2009 (-41,000) was much lower than\nthe average monthly decline for the first half of the year (-171,000). Since\nthe recession began, manufacturing employment has fallen by 2.1 million; three-\nfourths of this drop occurred in the durable goods component (-1.6 million).\n\nWholesale trade employment declined by 18,000 in December, with the majority of\nthe decline occurring among durable goods wholesalers. Employment in retail\ntrade was little changed over the month, although general merchandise stores\nlost 15,000 jobs.\n\nTemporary help services added 47,000 jobs in December. Since reaching a low\npoint in July, temporary help services employment has risen by 166,000.\n\nHealth care employment continued to increase in December (22,000), with notable\ngains in offices of physicians (9,000) and home health care services (8,000).\nThe health care industry has added 631,000 jobs since the recession began.\n\nIn December, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers on\nprivate nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 33.2 hours. The manufacturing work-\nweek, at 40.4 hours, and factory overtime, at 3.4 hours, were unchanged over\nthe month.

In the prior 3 months, payroll job losses\nhad averaged 135,000 a month. In November, employment fell in construction,\nmanufacturing, and information, while temporary help services and health care\nadded jobs.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn November, both the number of unemployed persons, at 15.4 million, and the\nunemployment rate, at 10.0 percent, edged down. At the start of the recession\nin December 2007, the number of unemployed persons was 7.5 million, and the\njobless rate was 4.9 percent. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, unemployment rates for adult men (10.5 per-\ncent), adult women (7.9 percent), teenagers (26.7 percent), whites (9.3 per-\ncent), blacks (15.6 percent), and Hispanics (12.7 percent) showed little\nchange in November. The unemployment rate for Asians was 7.3 percent, not\nseasonally adjusted. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of job losers and persons who completed tem-\nporary jobs fell by 463,000 in November. The number of long-term unemployed\n(those jobless for 27 weeks and over) rose by 293,000 to 5.9 million. The\npercentage of unemployed persons jobless for 27 weeks or more increased by\n2.7 percentage points to 38.3 percent. (See tables A-8 and A-9.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate was little changed in November at\n65.0 percent. The employment-population ratio was unchanged at 58.5 percent.\n(See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of people working part time for economic reasons (sometimes re-\nferred to as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed in November\nat 9.2 million. These individuals were working part time because their hours\nhad been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job. (See\ntable A-5.)\n\nAbout 2.3 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force in\nNovember, an increase of 376,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not sea-\nsonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and\nwere available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12\nmonths. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched\nfor work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-13.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 861,000 discouraged workers in\nNovember, up from 608,000 a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally ad-\njusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work be-\ncause they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.5 mil-\nlion persons marginally attached to the labor force had not searched for\nwork in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attend-\nance or family responsibilities.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment was essentially unchanged in November\n(-11,000). Job losses in the construction, manufacturing, and information\nindustries were offset by job gains in temporary help services and health\ncare. Since the recession began, payroll employment has decreased by 7.2 \nmillion. (See table B-1.)\n\nConstruction employment declined by 27,000 over the month. Job losses had\naveraged 117,000 per month during the 6 months ending in April and 63,000\nper month from May through October. In November, construction job losses\nwere concentrated among nonresidential specialty trade contractors\n(-29,000).\n\nManufacturing employment fell by 41,000 in November. The average monthly\ndecline for the past 5 months (-46,000) was much lower than the average\nmonthly job loss for the first half of this year (-171,000). About 2.1 mil-\nlion manufacturing jobs have been lost since December 2007; the majority of\nthis decline has occurred in durable goods manufacturing (-1.6 million).\n\nEmployment in the information industry fell by 17,000 in November. About\nhalf of the job loss occurred in its telecommunications component (-9,000).\n\nThere was little change in wholesale and retail trade employment in November.\nWithin retail trade, department stores added 8,000 jobs over the month.\n\nThe number of jobs in transportation and warehousing, financial activities,\nand leisure and hospitality showed little change over the month.\n\nEmployment in professional and business services rose by 86,000 in November.\nTemporary help services accounted for the majority of the increase, adding\n52,000 jobs. Since July, temporary help services employment has risen by\n117,000.\n\nHealth care employment continued to rise in November (21,000), with not-\nable gains in home health care services (7,000) and hospitals (7,000). The\nhealth care industry has added 613,000 jobs since the recession began in\nDecember 2007.\n\nIn November, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers\non private nonfarm payrolls rose by 0.2 hour to 33.2 hours. The manufacturing\nworkweek increased by 0.3 hour to 40.4 hours. Factory overtime rose by 0.1\nhour to 3.4 hours. Since May, the manufacturing workweek has increased by\n1.0 hour. (See table B-2.)\n\nIn November, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers\non private nonfarm payrolls edged up by 1 cent, or 0.1 percent, to $18.74.\nOver the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.2 percent,\nwhile average weekly earnings have risen by 1.6 percent. (See table B-3.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for September was revised from\n-219,000 to -139,000, and the change for October was revised from -190,000 to\n-111,000.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for December is scheduled to be released on Friday,\nJanuary 8, 2010, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n\n\n\n    ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n   |                                                                     |\n   |      Revision of Seasonally Adjusted Household Survey Data          |\n   |                                                                     |\n   |In accordance with usual practice, The Employment Situation release  |\n   |for December 2009, scheduled for January 8, 2010, will incorporate   |\n   |annual revisions in seasonally adjusted unemployment and other labor |\n   |force series from the household survey.

The largest job losses over the month were in con-\nstruction, manufacturing, and retail trade.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn October, the number of unemployed persons increased by 558,000 to 15.7 \nmillion. The unemployment rate rose by 0.4 percentage point to 10.2 percent, \nthe highest rate since April 1983. Since the start of the recession in \nDecember 2007, the number of unemployed persons has risen by 8.2 million, \nand the unemployment rate has grown by 5.3 percentage points. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (10.7 per-\ncent) and whites (9.5 percent) rose in October. The jobless rates for adult \nwomen (8.1 percent), teenagers (27.6 percent), blacks (15.7 percent), and\nHispanics (13.1 percent) were little changed over the month. The unemployment \nrate for Asians was 7.5 percent, not seasonally adjusted. (See tables A-1, \nA-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over) was \nlittle changed over the month at 5.6 million. In October, 35.6 percent of \nunemployed persons were jobless for 27 weeks or more. (See table A-9.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate was little changed over the month \nat 65.1 percent. The employment-population ratio continued to decline in \nOctober, falling to 58.5 percent. (See table A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons working part time for economic reasons (sometimes refer-\nred to as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed in October at 9.3 \nmillion. These individuals were working part time because their hours had been \ncut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job. (See table A-5.)\n\nAbout 2.4 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force in October, \nreflecting an increase of 736,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not sea-\nsonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and \nwere available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. \nThey were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in \nthe 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-13.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 808,000 discouraged workers in October, \nup from 484,000 a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Dis-\ncouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe \nno jobs are available for them. The other 1.6 million persons marginally attached \nto the labor force in October had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding \nthe survey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment declined by 190,000 in October. In the most re-\ncent 3 months, job losses have averaged 188,000 per month, compared with losses \naveraging 357,000 during the prior 3 months. In contrast, losses averaged 645,000 \nper month from November 2008 to April 2009. Since December 2007, payroll employment \nhas fallen by 7.3 million. (See table B-1.)\n\nConstruction employment decreased by 62,000 in October. Monthly job losses have \naveraged 67,000 during the most recent 6 months, compared with an average decline \nof 117,000 during the prior 6 months. October job losses were concentrated in \nnonresidential specialty trade contractors (-30,000) and in heavy construction \n(-14,000). Since December 2007, employment in construction has fallen by 1.6 mil-\nlion.\n\nManufacturing continued to shed jobs (-61,000) in October, with losses in both \ndurable and nondurable goods production. Over the past 4 months, job losses in \nmanufacturing have averaged 51,000 per month, compared with an average monthly \nloss of 161,000 from October 2008 through June 2009. Manufacturing employment has \nfallen by 2.1 million since December 2007.\n\nRetail trade lost 40,000 jobs in October. Employment declines were concentrated \nin sporting goods, hobby, book, and music stores (-16,000) and in department \nstores (-11,000). Employment in transportation and warehousing decreased by 18,000 \nin October.\n\nHealth care employment continued to increase in October (29,000).

The largest job losses were in construction,\nmanufacturing, retail trade, and government.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nSince the start of the recession in December 2007, the number of unemployed\npersons has increased by 7.6 million to 15.1 million, and the unemployment\nrate has doubled to 9.8 percent. (See table A-1.)\n\nUnemployment rates for the major worker groups--adult men (10.3 percent),\nadult women (7.8 percent), teenagers (25.9 percent), whites (9.0 percent),\nblacks (15.4 percent), and Hispanics (12.7 percent)--showed little change\nin September. The unemployment rate for Asians was 7.4 percent, not season-\nally adjusted. The rates for all major worker groups are much higher than\nat the start of the recession. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of job losers and persons who completed\ntemporary jobs rose by 603,000 to 10.4 million in September. The number of\nlong-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over) rose by 450,000\nto 5.4 million. In September, 35.6 percent of unemployed persons were job-\nless for 27 weeks or more. (See tables A-8 and A-9.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate declined by 0.3 percentage point\nin September to 65.2 percent. The employment-population ratio, at 58.8 per-\ncent, also declined over the month and has decreased by 3.9 percentage points\nsince the recession began in December 2007. (See table A-1.)\n\nIn September, the number of persons working part time for economic reasons\n(sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed\nat 9.2 million. The number of such workers rose sharply throughout most of\nthe fall and winter but has been little changed since March. (See table A-5.)\n\nAbout 2.2 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force in\nSeptember, an increase of 615,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not sea-\nsonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and\nwere available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12\nmonths. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for\nwork in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See table A-13.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 706,000 discouraged workers in\nSeptember, up by 239,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally\nadjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work\nbecause they believe no jobs are available for them. The other 1.5 million\npersons marginally attached to the labor force in September had not searched\nfor work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school\nattendance or family responsibilities.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment declined by 263,000 in September. From May\nthrough September, job losses averaged 307,000 per month, compared with los-\nses averaging 645,000 per month from November 2008 to April. Since the start\nof the recession in December 2007, payroll employment has fallen by 7.2 mil-\nlion. (See table B-1.)\n\nIn September, construction employment declined by 64,000. Monthly job los-\nses averaged 66,000 from May through September, compared with an average of\n117,000 per month from November to April. September job cuts were concen-\ntrated in the industry's nonresidential components (-39,000) and in heavy\nconstruction (-12,000). Since December 2007, employment in construction has\nfallen by 1.5 million.\n\nEmployment in manufacturing fell by 51,000 in September. Over the past 3\nmonths, job losses have averaged 53,000 per month, compared with an average\nmonthly loss of 161,000 from October to June. Employment in manufacturing\nhas contracted by 2.1 million since the onset of the recession.\n\nIn the service-providing sector, the number of jobs in retail trade fell by\n39,000 in September. From April through September, retail employment has\nfallen by an average of 29,000 per month, compared with an average monthly\nloss of 68,000 for the prior 6-month period.\n\nGovernment employment was down by 53,000 in September, with the largest\ndecline occurring in the non-education component of local government\n(-24,000).\n\nEmployment in health care continued to increase in September (19,000), with\nthe largest gain occurring in ambulatory health care services (15,000).\nHealth care has added 559,000 jobs since the beginning of the recession,\nalthough the average monthly job gain thus far in 2009 (22,000) is down from\nthe average monthly gain during 2008 (30,000).\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing continued to trend down in\nSeptember. The number of jobs in financial activities, professional and\nbusiness services, leisure and hospitality, and information showed little\nor no change over the month.\n\nIn September, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers\non private nonfarm payrolls edged down by 0.1 hour to 33.0 hours. Both the\nmanufacturing workweek and factory overtime decreased by 0.1 hour over the\nmonth, to 39.8 and 2.8 hours, respectively. (See table B-2.)\n\nIn September, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory\nworkers on private nonfarm payrolls edged up by 1 cent, or 0.1 percent, to\n$18.67. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.5\npercent, while average weekly earnings have risen by only 0.7 percent due\nto declines in the average workweek. (See table B-3.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for July was revised from\n-276,000 to -304,000, and the change for August was revised from -216,000\nto -201,000.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for October is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, November 6, 2009, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable A.

Preliminary Estimates of Benchmark Revisions to the Establishment Survey\n\nIn accordance with usual practice, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\nis announcing its preliminary estimates of the upcoming annual benchmark\nrevision to the establishment survey employment series. The final bench-\nmark revision will be issued on February 5, 2010, with the publication\nof the January 2010 Employment Situation news release.\n\nEach year, the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey employment\nestimates are benchmarked to comprehensive counts of employment for the\nmonth of March. These counts are derived from state unemployment insur-\nance tax records that nearly all employers are required to file. For\nnational CES employment series, the annual benchmark revisions over the\nlast 10 years have averaged plus or minus two-tenths of one percent of\ntotal nonfarm employment. The preliminary estimate of the benchmark\nrevision indicates a downward adjustment to March 2009 total nonfarm\nemployment of 824,000 (0.6 percent).\n\nTable B shows the March 2009 preliminary benchmark revisions by major\nindustry sector. As is typically the case, many of the individual indus-\ntry series show larger percentage revisions than the total nonfarm ser-\nies, primarily because statistical sampling error is greater at more\ndetailed levels than at a total level.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable B.

    "2009-08": "Transmission of material in this release is embargoed       USDL-09-1067\nuntil 8:30 a.m. (EDT) September 4, 2009\n\nTechnical information:\n Household data:     (202) 691-6378     CPSinfo@bls.gov  www.bls.gov/cps\n Establishment data: (202) 691-6555     CESinfo@bls.gov  www.bls.gov/ces\n \nMedia contact:       (202) 691-5902     PressOffice@bls.gov\n\n\n                THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION -- AUGUST 2009\n\n\nNonfarm payroll employment continued to decline in August (-216,000),\nand the unemployment rate rose to 9.7 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor\nStatistics reported today. Although job losses continued in many of the\nmajor industry sectors in August, the declines have moderated in recent\nmonths.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn August, the number of unemployed persons increased by 466,000 to 14.9\nmillion, and the unemployment rate rose by 0.3 percentage point to 9.7\npercent. The rate had been little changed in June and July, after in-\ncreasing 0.4 or 0.5 percentage point in each month from December 2008\nthrough May. Since the recession began in December 2007, the number of\nunemployed persons has risen by 7.4 million, and the unemployment rate\nhas grown by 4.8 percentage points. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men\n(10.1 percent), whites (8.9 percent), and Hispanics (13.0 percent) rose\nin August. The jobless rates for adult women (7.6 percent), teenagers\n(25.5 percent), and blacks (15.1 percent) were little changed over the\nmonth. The unemployment rate for Asians was 7.5 percent, not seasonally\nadjusted. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate remained at 65.5 percent in\nAugust. The employment-population ratio, at 59.2 percent, edged down\nover the month and has declined by 3.5 percentage points since the re-\ncession began in December 2007. (See table A-1.)\n\nIn August, the number of persons working part time for economic reasons\nwas little changed at 9.1 million. These individuals indicated that they\nwere working part time because their hours had been cut back or because \nthey were unable to find a full-time job. The number of such workers\nrose sharply in the fall and winter but has been little changed since\nMarch. (See table A-5.)\n\nAbout 2.3 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force\nin August, reflecting an increase of 630,000 from a year earlier. (The\ndata are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the\nlabor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a\njob sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed\nbecause they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the sur-\nvey. (See table A-13.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, the number of discouraged workers in\nAugust (758,000) has nearly doubled over the past 12 months. (The data\nare not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not cur-\nrently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for\nthem. The other 1.5 million persons marginally attached to the labor\nforce in August had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the\nsurvey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment declined by 216,000 in August. Since\nDecember 2007, employment has fallen by 6.9 million. In recent months,\njob losses have moderated in many major industry sectors. (See table\nB-1.)\n\nIn August, construction employment declined by 65,000, in line with\nthe trend since May. Monthly losses had averaged 117,000 over the 6\nmonths ending in April. Employment in the construction industry has\ncontracted by 1.4 million since the onset of the recession. Starting\nin early 2009, the larger share of monthly job losses shifted from the\nresidential to the nonresidential and heavy construction components.\nIn mining, employment declined by 9,000 over the month.\n\nIn August, manufacturing employment continued to trend downward, with\na decline of 63,000. The pace of job loss has slowed throughout manu-\nfacturing in recent months. Motor vehicles and parts lost 15,000 jobs\nin August, partly offsetting a 31,000 employment increase in July.\n\nFinancial activities shed 28,000 jobs in August, with declines spread\nthroughout the industry. Job loss in financial activities has slowed\nsince the beginning of the year. Employment in the industry has de-\nclined by 537,000 since the start of the recession.\n\nWholesale trade employment fell by 17,000 in August. Employment in\ninformation continued to trend down over the month.\n\nEmployment in the retail trade industry was little changed in August.\nEmployment also was little changed in professional and business ser-\nvices over the month. From May through August, monthly employment\ndeclines in the sector averaged 46,000, compared with 138,000 per\nmonth from November through April. Job loss in its temporary help\nservices component has slowed markedly over the last 4 months.\n\nEmployment was little changed in August both in transportation and\nwarehousing, and in leisure and hospitality.\n\nEmployment in health care continued to rise in August (28,000), with\ngains in ambulatory care and in nursing and residential care. Employ-\nment in hospitals was little changed in August; job growth in the\nindustry slowed in early 2009 and employment has been flat since May. \nHealth care has added 544,000 jobs since the start of the recession.\n\nIn August, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory\nworkers on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 33.1 hours.\nThe manufacturing workweek and factory overtime also showed no \nchange over the month (at 39.8 hours and 2.9 hours, respectively).\n(See table B-2.)\n\nIn August, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory\nworkers on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 6 cents, or 0.3 percent,\nto $18.65. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen\nby 2.6 percent, while average weekly earnings have risen by only 0.8\npercent due to declines in the average workweek. (See table B-3.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for June was revised\nfrom -443,000 to -463,000, and the change for July was revised from\n-247,000 to -276,000.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for September is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, October 2, 2009, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).\n\n\n\nTable A.

    "2009-07": "\n\nTransmission of material in this release is embargoed       USDL-09-0908\nuntil 8:30 a.m. (EDT) Friday, August 7, 2009\n\nTechnical information:\n Household data:     (202) 691-6378     CPSinfo@bls.gov  www.bls.gov/cps\n Establishment data: (202) 691-6555     CESinfo@bls.gov  www.bls.gov/ces\n \nMedia contact:       (202) 691-5902     PressOffice@bls.gov\n\n\n                 THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION -- JULY 2009\n\n\nNonfarm payroll employment continued to decline in July (-247,000),\nand the unemployment rate was little changed at 9.4 percent, the U.S.\nBureau of Labor Statistics reported today. The average monthly job\nloss for May through July (-331,000) was about half the average\ndecline for November through April (-645,000). In July, job losses\ncontinued in many of the major industry sectors.\n\nHousehold Survey Data\n\nIn July, the number of unemployed persons was 14.5 million. The\nunemployment rate was 9.4 percent, little changed for the second \nconsecutive month. (See table A-1.)\n\nAmong the major worker groups, unemployment rates for adult men (9.8\npercent), adult women (7.5 percent), teenagers (23.8 percent), whites\n(8.6 percent), blacks (14.5 percent), and Hispanics (12.3 percent)\nwere little changed in July. The unemployment rate for Asians was 8.3\npercent, not seasonally adjusted. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) \nrose by 584,000 over the month to 5.0 million. In July, 1 in 3 unemploy-\ned persons were jobless for 27 weeks or more. (See table A-9.)\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate declined by 0.2 percentage\npoint in July to 65.5 percent. The employment-population ratio, at 59.4 \npercent, was little changed over the month but has declined by 3.3 per-\ncentage points since the recession began in December 2007. (See\ntable A-1.)\n\nThe number of persons working part time for economic reasons (sometimes \nreferred to as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed in July \nat 8.8 million. The number of such workers rose sharply in the fall and \nwinter but has been little changed for 4 consecutive months. \n(See table A-5.)\n\nAbout 2.3 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force\nin July, 709,000 more than a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally \nadjusted.) These individuals, who were not in the labor force, wanted \nand were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the \nprior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had \nnot searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. (See \ntable A-13.)\n\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 796,000 discouraged workers\nin July, up by 335,000 over the past 12 months. (The data are not\nseasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently\nlooking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them.\nThe other 1.5 million persons marginally attached to the labor force\nin July had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey\nfor reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.\n\nEstablishment Survey Data\n\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment declined by 247,000 in July. From May\nto July, job losses averaged 331,000 per month, compared with losses\naveraging 645,000 per month from November to April. Since December\n2007, payroll employment has fallen by 6.7 million. (See table B-1.)\n\nEmployment in construction declined by 76,000 in July, about in line\nwith the average for the past 3 months (-73,000). Employment had de-\ncreased by 117,000 a month on average from November to April.\n\nManufacturing employment fell by 52,000 in July and has declined by\n2.0 million since the recession began. In motor vehicles and parts,\nfewer workers than usual were laid off in July for seasonal retool-\ning. As a result, the estimate of employment for the industry rose \nby 28,000 after seasonal adjustment. In large part, July's seasonally- \nadjusted increase reflects the fact that previous job cuts had been \nso extensive that there were fewer workers to lay off during the sea-\nsonal shutdown. Elsewhere in manufacturing, several industries con-\ntinued to lose jobs in July, including machinery (-15,000) and fabri-\ncated metal products (-14,000).\n\nIn July, retail trade employment declined by 44,000. Job losses in the\nindustry had averaged 27,000 per month over the prior 3 months. Em-\nployment in wholesale trade fell by 19,000 in July, with the majority \nof the decline occurring among durable goods wholesalers.\n\nEmployment in professional and business services continued to trend\ndown in July (-38,000); the industry has shed 1.5 million jobs since\nthe start of the recession. Within professional and business services, \nemployment in the temporary help industry edged down in July. While \ntemporary help has lost 844,000 jobs since the recession began, the \ndeclines have lessened substantially over the past 3 months.\n\nTransportation and warehousing lost 22,000 jobs in July. Since May, \nthe average monthly job loss was half the average monthly decline for \nNovember through April (-17,000 versus -34,000).\n\nFinancial activities employment continued to trend down in July \n(-13,000). The average monthly decline for this industry was 23,000 \nover the past 3 months compared with 46,000 per month from November \nthrough April. Since the start of the recession, the financial acti-\nvities industry has lost 501,000 jobs. Employment in information de-\nclined by 16,000 in July, including losses in publishing and telecom-\nmunications.\n\nHealth care employment increased by 20,000 in July, about in line \nwith the average monthly gain for the first half of this year but \ndown from an average monthly increase of 30,000 during 2008. Employ-\nment in lei-sure and hospitality has been little changed over the \npast 3 months.\n\nIn July, the average workweek of production and nonsupervisory work-\ners on private nonfarm payrolls edged up by 0.1 hour to 33.1 hours. \nThe manufacturing workweek increased by 0.3 hour to 39.8 hours. Fac-\ntory overtime was unchanged at 2.9 hours. (See table B-2.)\n\nIn July, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory\nworkers on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 3 cents, or 0.2 percent,\nto $18.56. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have\nincreased by 2.5 percent, while average weekly earnings have risen \nby only 1.0 percent due to declines in the average workweek. (See \ntable B-3.)\n\nThe change in total nonfarm payroll employment for May was revised\nfrom -322,000 to -303,000, and the change for June was revised from -\n467,000 to -443,000.\n\n_____________\nThe Employment Situation for August is scheduled to be released on Friday, \nSeptember 4, 2009, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).\n\n\n\nTable A.

The employment-popula-\ntion ratio has declined by 3.2 percentage points since the start of\nthe recession in December 2007.  (See table A-1.)\n   \n   The number of persons working part time for economic reasons\n(sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) was little\nchanged in June at 9.0 million.  Since the start of the recession, the\nnumber of such workers has increased by 4.4 million.  (See table A-5.)\n   \nPersons Not in the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n   \n   About 2.2 million persons (not seasonally adjusted) were marginally\nattached to the labor force in June, 618,000 more than a year earlier.\nThese individuals wanted and were available for work and had looked\nfor a job sometime in the past 12 months.  They were not counted as\nunemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks\npreceding the survey.  Among the marginally attached, there were\n793,000 discouraged workers in June, up by 373,000 from a year\nearlier.  Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for\nwork because they believe no jobs are available for them.  The other\n1.4 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in June\nhad not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for\nreasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.  (See\ntable A-13.)\n   \nIndustry Payroll Employment (Establishment Survey Data)\n   \n   Total nonfarm payroll employment continued to decline in June \n(-467,000).  Job losses from April to June averaged 436,000 per month, \ncompared with losses averaging 670,000 per month from November to \nMarch.  Since the recession began in December 2007, payroll employment \nhas fallen by 6.5 million.  In June, job losses continued to be wide-\nspread across major industry sectors.  (See table B-1.)\n   \n   Employment in manufacturing fell by 136,000 over the month and has\ndeclined by 1.9 million during the recession.  Within the durable\ngoods industry, motor vehicles and parts (-27,000), fabricated metal \nproducts (-18,000), computer and electronic products (-16,000), and \nmachinery (-14,000) continued to lose jobs in June.  Since the reces-\nsion began, employment in motor vehicles and parts has declined by \n335,000, or about one-third.\n   \n   In June, employment in construction fell by 79,000, with losses\nspread throughout the industry.  Since the start of the recession,\nconstruction employment has fallen by 1.3 million.  Mining employ-\nment fell by 8,000 in June, about in line with the average monthly\ndecline since its recent peak in October 2008.\n   \n   Employment in the professional and business services industry\ndeclined by 118,000 in June.  This industry has shed 1.5 million jobs\nsince an employment peak in December 2007.  Within this sector, employ-\nment in temporary help services fell by 38,000 in June; this industry \nhas lost 848,000 jobs since the start of the recession.\n   \n                             - 4 -\n                             \n   Retail trade employment edged down in June (-21,000); job losses in\nretail trade have moderated in the past 3 months.

Employment con-\ntinued to fall in wholesale trade (-16,000).\n   \n   In June, financial activities employment continued to decline \n(-27,000).  Since the start of the recession, this industry has lost\n489,000 jobs.  In June, employment declined in credit intermediation\nand related activities (-10,000) and in securities, commodity contracts, \nand investments (-6,000).\n   \n   The information industry lost 21,000 jobs over the month and\n187,000 since the start of the recession.  Publishing accounted for\nabout half of the employment decline in the information industry\nduring the recession.\n   \n   Health care employment increased by 21,000 in June.  Job gains in\nhealth care have averaged 21,000 per month thus far in 2009, down from\nan average of 30,000 per month during 2008.  Employment in federal\ngovernment fell by 49,000 in June, largely due to the layoff of work-\ners temporarily hired to prepare for Census 2010.\n   \n   The change in total nonfarm employment for April was revised from \n-504,000 to -519,000, and the change for May was revised from -345,000\nto -322,000.\n   \nWeekly Hours (Establishment Survey Data)\n   \n   In June, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory\nworkers on private nonfarm payrolls fell by 0.1 hour to 33.0 hours--the\nlowest level on record for the series, which began in 1964.  The manu-\nfacturing workweek rose by 0.1 hour to 39.5 hours, and factory overtime \nwas unchanged at 2.8 hours.  (See table B-2.)\n   \n   The index of aggregate weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory \nworkers on private nonfarm payrolls fell by 0.8 percent in June.  The \nmanufacturing index declined by 1.2 percent over the month.  (See \ntable B-5.)\n   \nHourly and Weekly Earnings (Establishment Survey Data)\n   \n   In June, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory\nworkers on private nonfarm payrolls were unchanged at $18.53.  Over\nthe past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 2.7 per-\ncent, while weekly earnings have risen by only 0.9 percent, reflecting \na decline in the average workweek.

The employment-population ratio, at 59.7 percent, con-\ntinued to trend down.  The ratio has declined by 3.0 percentage points since \nDecember 2007.  (See table A-1.)\n\n   The number of persons working part time for economic reasons (sometimes \nreferred to as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed in May at \n9.1 million.  The number of such workers has risen by 4.4 million during the \nrecession.  (See table A-5.)\n\nPersons Not in the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   About 2.2 million persons (not seasonally adjusted) were marginally at-\ntached to the labor force in May, 794,000 more than a year earlier.  These \nindividuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job \nsometime in the prior 12 months.  They were not counted as unemployed be-\ncause they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  \nAmong the marginally attached, there were 792,000 discouraged workers in \nMay, up by 392,000 from a year earlier.  Discouraged workers are persons \nnot currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available \nfor them.  The other 1.4 million persons marginally attached to the labor \nforce in May had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey \nfor reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.  (See \ntable A-13.)\n\nIndustry Payroll Employment (Establishment Survey Data)\n   \n   Total nonfarm payroll employment declined by 345,000 in May to 132.2\nmillion.  The decline was about half of the average monthly job loss for\nthe prior 6 months (-643,000).  Since the recession began in December\n2007, payroll employment has fallen by 6.0 million.  In May, job losses\ncontinued to be widespread across major industry sectors.  Steep job\nlosses continued in manufacturing, while the rate of decline moderated in\nseveral industries, including construction, professional and business\nservices, and retail trade.  (See table B-1.)\n   \n   Manufacturing employment fell by 156,000 in May.  Job losses occurred\nin most component industries.  Three durable goods industries--motor\nvehicles and parts (-30,000), machinery (-26,000), and fabricated metal\nproducts (-19,000)--accounted for about half of the overall decline in\nfactory employment.  Since its most recent peak in February 2000, employ-\nment in motor vehicles and parts has fallen by about 50 percent.  Mining \nshed 11,000 jobs in May, about the same number as in April.\n   \n   Employment in construction decreased by 59,000 in May, compared with\nan average monthly job loss of 117,000 in the industry for the previous 6\nmonths.  In May, employment fell in nonresidential specialty trade con-\ntractors (-30,000) and in residential construction of buildings (-11,000).\n\n   Job losses in professional and business services moderated in May,\nwith the industry shedding 51,000 jobs.  This compares with an average\nloss of 136,000 jobs per month in the prior 6 months.  The temporary help\nservices industry, which had been dropping an average of 73,000 jobs per\nmonth over this period, saw little employment change in May (-7,000).\n   \n   Employment in leisure and hospitality was flat over the month.  The\nindustry had lost an average of 39,000 jobs per month during the prior 6\nmonths.\n\n\n                                - 4 -\n\n\n   Retail trade employment was down by 18,000 in May; job cutbacks in re-\ntail trade have moderated markedly in the past 2 months.  Employment in \nwholesale trade fell by 22,000 over the month, with over half of the de-\ncrease (-14,000) among durable goods wholesalers.\n   \n   Financial activities employment continued to decrease in May (-30,000).  \nSecurities lost 10,000 jobs and real estate lost 9,000.  Employment in \ncredit intermediation continued to trend down, although the May job loss \nwas well below the average job loss for the prior 6 months.  Employment \nin information decreased by 24,000 in May.\n   \n   Health care employment increased by 24,000 in May, about in line with\nits average monthly job growth so far in 2009.  Employment in government\nchanged little in May.\n   \n   The change in total nonfarm employment for March was revised from \n-699,000 to -652,000, and the change for April was revised from -539,000\nto -504,000.\n\nWeekly Hours (Establishment Survey Data)\n   \n   In May, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers\non private nonfarm payrolls edged down by 0.1 hour to 33.1 hours, season-\nally adjusted.  The manufacturing workweek decreased by 0.2 hour to 39.3 \nhours, and factory overtime was unchanged at 2.7 hours.  (See table B-2.)\n   \n   The index of aggregate weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory\nworkers on private nonfarm payrolls fell by 0.7 percent in May.  The manu-\nfacturing index declined by 2.1 percent over the month.  (See table B-5.)\n   \nHourly and Weekly Earnings (Establishment Survey Data)\n   \n   In May, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory\nworkers on private nonfarm payrolls were essentially unchanged at $18.54,\nseasonally adjusted.  Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings\nincreased by 3.1 percent, while average weekly earnings rose by only 1.2\npercent, reflecting a decline in the average workweek.  (See table B-3.)\n   \n                     ______________________________\n\n   \n   The Employment Situation for June 2009 is scheduled to be released on\nThursday, July 2, at 8:30 A.M.

Since the recession\nbegan in December 2007, 5.7 million jobs have been lost.  In April, job los-\nses were large and widespread across nearly all major private-sector indus-\ntries. Overall, private-sector employment fell by 611,000.\n\nUnemployment (Household Survey Data)\n\n   The number of unemployed persons increased by 563,000 to 13.7 million in\nApril, and the unemployment rate rose to 8.9 percent.  Over the past 12 months,\nthe number of unemployed persons has risen by 6.0 million, and the unemployment\nrate has grown by 3.9 percentage points. (See table A-1.)\n\n   Unemployment rates rose in April for adult men (9.4 percent) and blacks\n(15.0 percent).  The jobless rates for adult women (7.1 percent), teenagers\n(21.5 percent), whites (8.0 percent), and Hispanics (11.3 percent) were little\nchanged over the month.  The unemployment rate for Asians was 6.6 percent in\nApril, not seasonally adjusted, up from 3.2 percent a year earlier.  (See\ntables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\n   Among the unemployed, the number of job losers and persons who completed\ntemporary jobs rose by 571,000 in April to 8.8 million. This group has more\nthan doubled in size over the past 12 months.  (See table A-8.)\n\n   The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more)\nincreased by 498,000 to 3.7 million over the month and has risen by 2.4 mil-\nlion since the start of the recession in December 2007.  (See table A-9.)\n\nTotal Employment and the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   The civilian labor force participation rate rose in April to 65.8 percent,\nand the employment-population ratio was unchanged at 59.9 percent.  The employ-\nment-population ratios for adult men and women showed little or no change over\nthe month.  However, since December 2007, the men's ratio was down by 4.4 per-\ncentage points, while the women's ratio was down by 1.3 percentage points.\n(See table A-1.)\n\n   In April, the number of persons working part time for economic reasons\n(sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) was essentially un-\nchanged at 8.9 million; however, the number of such workers has risen by 3.7\nmillion over the past 12 months.

               - 3 -\n\n\nPersons Not in the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   About 2.1 million persons (not seasonally adjusted) were marginally attached\nto the labor force in April, 675,000 more than a year earlier.  These indivi-\nduals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in\nthe prior 12 months.  They were not counted as unemployed because they had not\nsearched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  Among the marginally\nattached, there were 740,000 discouraged workers in April, up by 328,000 from a\nyear earlier.  Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work\nbecause they believe no jobs are available for them.  The other 1.4 million per-\nsons marginally attached to the labor force in April had not searched for work\nin the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or\nfamily responsibilities.  (See table A-13.)\n\nIndustry Payroll Employment (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   Nonfarm payroll employment fell by 539,000 in April to 132.4 million; pri-\nvate-sector employment declined by 611,000.  Since the recession began in\nDecember 2007, payroll employment has fallen by 5.7 million.  In April, job los-\nses continued in most major private-sector industries.  Employment rose in the\nfederal government mainly due to hiring of temporary workers for Census 2010.\n(See table B-1.)\n\n   Employment in manufacturing fell by 149,000 over the month, with widespread\njob losses among the component industries.  Three durable goods industries--\ntransportation equipment (-34,000), fabricated metal products (-29,000), and\nmachinery (-22,000)--accounted for more than half of the decline.  Since\nSeptember 2008, manufacturing has lost 1.2 million jobs.\n\n   Construction employment declined by 110,000 in April, with losses spread\nthroughout the sector.  Over the past 6 months, job losses have averaged\n120,000 per month, compared with 46,000 per month from December 2007 through\nOctober 2008.\n\n   The professional and business services industry lost 122,000 jobs in April.\nThis industry has shed an average of 139,000 jobs per month since October 2008.\nHalf of the April decline occurred in temporary help services.\n\n   Employment in retail trade fell by 47,000 in April.  Job losses in department\nstores (-14,000), automobile dealers (-9,000), and building material and garden\nsupply stores (-8,000) accounted for most of the decline.  Wholesale trade em-\nployment was down by 41,000 over the month, with much of the decrease among dur-\nable goods wholesalers.\n\n   Employment in transportation and warehousing declined by 38,000 in April,\nwith losses concentrated in truck transportation (-16,000) and warehousing and\nstorage (-8,000).  Employment in financial activities declined by 40,000 over\nthe month.  Job losses occurred throughout the sector, including real estate and\nrental and leasing (-15,000) and credit intermediation and related activities\n(-14,000).  The leisure and hospitality industry lost 44,000 jobs in April.\n\n   Health care employment grew by 17,000 in April.  Job gains in health care\nhave averaged 17,000 per month thus far in 2009, down from an average of 30,000\nper month during 2008.  Employment in federal government rose by 66,000 over the\nmonth largely due to the hiring of temporary workers for Census 2010 preparatory\nwork.\n\n\n                                   - 4 -\n\n\n   The change in total nonfarm employment for February was revised from -651,000\nto -681,000, and the change for March was revised from -663,000 to -699,000.\nMonthly revisions result from additional sample reports and the monthly recal-\nculation of seasonal factors.\n\nWeekly Hours (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   In April, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers on\nprivate nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 33.2 hours, seasonally adjusted.  The\nmanufacturing workweek increased by 0.2 hour to 39.6 hours, and factory overtime\nrose by 0.1 hour to 2.7 hours.  (See table B-2.)\n\n   The index of aggregate weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory workers\non private nonfarm payrolls fell by 0.6 percent in April.

Since the recession \nbegan in December 2007, 5.1 million jobs have been lost, with almost two-thirds \n(3.3 million) of the decrease occurring in the last 5 months.  In March, job \nlosses were large and widespread across the major industry sectors.\n\nUnemployment (Household Survey Data)\n\n   In March, the number of unemployed persons increased by 694,000 to 13.2 mil-\nlion, and the unemployment rate rose to 8.5 percent.  Over the past 12 months, \nthe number of unemployed persons has grown by about 5.3 million, and the unem-\nployment rate has risen by 3.4 percentage points. Half of the increase in both \nthe number of unemployed and the unemployment rate occurred in the last 4 months.  \n(See table A-1.)\n\n   The unemployment rates continued to trend upward in March for adult men (8.8 \npercent), adult women (7.0 percent), whites (7.9 percent), and Hispanics (11.4 \npercent).  The jobless rates for blacks (13.3 percent) and teenagers (21.7 per-\ncent) were little changed over the month.  The unemployment rate for Asians was \n6.4 percent in March, not seasonally adjusted, up from 3.6 percent a year earlier.  \n(See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n   \n   Among the unemployed, the number of job losers and persons who completed tem-\nporary jobs increased by 547,000 to 8.2 million in March.  This group has nearly \ndoubled in size over the past 12 months.  (See table A-8.)\n   \n   The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) rose \nto 3.2 million over the month and has increased by about 1.9 million since the \nstart of the recession in December 2007.

rate (65.5 percent) was little changed \nin March.  The employment-population ratio fell by 0.4 percentage point to 59.9 \npercent.  The employment-population ratio for adult men was 68.2 percent in March, \ndown 4.3 percentage points since December 2007.  The employment-population ratio \nfor adult women was 56.8 percent, down 1.3 percentage points since the beginning \nof the recession.  (See table A-1.)\n   \n   In March, the number of persons working part time for economic reasons (some-\ntimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) climbed by 423,000 to 9.0 \nmillion.  (See table A-5.)\n\nPersons Not in the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   About 2.1 million persons (not seasonally adjusted) were marginally attached \nto the labor force in March, 754,000 more than a year earlier.  These individ-\nuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in \nthe prior 12 months.  They were not counted as unemployed because they had not \nsearched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  Among the marginally \nattached, there were 685,000 discouraged workers in March, up by 284,000 from \na year earlier.  Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work \nbecause they believe no jobs are available for them.  The other 1.4 million \npersons marginally attached to the labor force in March had not searched for \nwork in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance \nor family responsibilities.  (See table A-13.)\n   \nIndustry Payroll Employment (Establishment Survey Data)\n   \n   Total nonfarm payroll employment continued to fall sharply (-663,000) in \nMarch.  Payroll employment has declined by 3.3 million in the past 5 months.  \nIn March, job losses were large and extended across nearly all major industry \nsectors.  (See table B-1.)\n   \n   Manufacturing employment fell by 161,000 in March, with widespread job losses \noccurring among the component industries.  Factory employment has declined by \n1.0 million over the past 6 months.  In March, the largest decreases occurred\nin fabricated metal products (-28,000), machinery (-27,000), and transportation \nequipment (-26,000).\n   \n   The construction industry lost 126,000 jobs in March, with declines occur-\nring throughout the industry.  Employment in construction has fallen by 1.3 mil-\nlion since peaking in January 2007; nearly half of that decline occurred over \nthe last 5 months.  In March, employment fell in specialty trade contractors \n(-83,000) and construction of buildings (-33,000).  These declines were split \nabout evenly between the residential and nonresidential portions of these in-\ndustries.  Heavy and civil engineering construction also lost 10,000 jobs.  Em-\nployment in mining and logging declined by 18,000 in March.\n\n                                  - 4 -\n                                  \n   \n   Employment in professional and business services fell by 133,000 in March, \nwith declines throughout most of the sector.  More than half of the loss occurred\nin temporary help services, which cut 72,000 jobs in March and 767,000 since \nDecember 2007.  In March, architectural and engineering services lost 16,000 jobs.\n   \n   Retail trade employment fell by 48,000 over the month.  Since peaking in \nNovember 2007, employment in the industry has declined by an average of 44,000 \nper month.  In March, employment decreased in building material and garden \nsupply stores (-13,000), automobile dealerships (-12,000), and electronics and \nappliance stores (-10,000).  Employment in wholesale trade fell by 31,000 in \nMarch, with nearly all of the decline occurring in durable goods.\n   \n   Employment in financial activities continued to decline in March (-43,000).  \nThe number of jobs in this industry has dropped by 495,000 since an employment \npeak in December 2006.  More than half of this loss occurred in the past 7 \nmonths.  In March, job losses occurred in credit intermediation (-15,000); real \nestate (-12,000); and securities, commodity contracts, and investments (-7,000).\n   \n   Leisure and hospitality shed 40,000 jobs in March, with most of the decrease \nin the accommodation industry (-23,000).  The leisure and hospitality industry \nhas lost 351,000 jobs since an employment peak in December 2007.\n   \n   Transportation and warehousing lost 34,000 jobs in March, raising total job \nlosses to 265,000 since employment peaked in December 2007.  In March, employ-\nment declined in truck transportation (-15,000), support activities for trans-\nportation (-7,000), and couriers and messengers (-5,000).  Health care employ-\nment continued to trend up in March (14,000); however, monthly job growth in \nthe first quarter averaged 17,000 compared with 30,000 per month in 2008.\n   \n   The change in total nonfarm employment for January was revised from -655,000 \nto -741,000, while the change for February remained -651,000.  Monthly revisions \nresult from additional sample reports and the monthly recalculation of seasonal \nfactors.\n   \nWeekly Hours (Establishment Survey Data)\n   \n   In March, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers on \nprivate nonfarm payrolls fell by 0.1 hour to 33.2 hours, seasonally adjusted--the \nlowest level on record for the series, which began in 1964.  The manufacturing \nworkweek decreased by 0.2 hour to 39.3 hours, and factory overtime was unchanged \nat 2.7 hours.  (See table B-2.)\n   \n   The index of aggregate weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory workers \non private nonfarm payrolls fell by 1.0 percent in March.  The manufacturing index \ndeclined by 2.1 percent over the month.  (See table B-5.)\n   \nHourly and Weekly Earnings (Establishment Survey Data)\n   \n   In March, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers on \nprivate nonfarm payrolls rose by 3 cents, or 0.2 percent, seasonally adjusted.  \nThis followed a gain of 4 cents in February.  Over the past 12 months, average hour-\nly earnings increased by 3.4 percent, and average weekly earnings rose by 1.5 per-\ncent.

             - 3 -\n\nTotal Employment and the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   The civilian labor force participation rate was about unchanged at 65.6 per-\ncent.  The employment-population ratio, at 60.3 percent in February, continued \nto trend down.  The ratio has declined by 2.4 percentage points over the year.  \n(See table A-1.)\n\n   In February, the number of persons who worked part time for economic rea-\nsons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) rose by 787,000, \nreaching 8.6 million.  The number of such workers rose by 3.7 million over \nthe past 12 months.  This category includes persons who would like to work \nfull time but were working part time because their hours had been cut back \nor because they were unable to find full-time jobs.  (See table A-5.)\n\nPersons Not in the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   About 2.1 million persons (not seasonally adjusted) were marginally at-\ntached to the labor force in February, 466,000 more than a year earlier.  \nThese individuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a \njob sometime in the prior 12 months.  They were not counted as unemployed \nbecause they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  \nAmong the marginally attached, there were 731,000 discouraged workers in \nFebruary, up by 335,000 from a year earlier.  Discouraged workers are per-\nsons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are avail-\nable for them.  The other 1.3 million persons marginally attached to the \nlabor force in February had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding \nthe survey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.  \n(See table A-13.)\n\nIndustry Payroll Employment (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   Total nonfarm payroll employment dropped by 651,000 in February.  Since \nthe recession began in December 2007, about 4.4 million jobs have been lost, \nwith more than half (2.6 million) of the decrease occurring in the last 4 \nmonths.  In February, employment declined in most major industry sectors, \nwith the largest losses occurring in professional and business services, \nmanufacturing, and construction.  Health care continued to add jobs over \nthe month.  (See table B-1.)\n   \n   Employment in professional and business services fell by 180,000 in\nFebruary.  The temporary help industry lost 78,000 jobs over the month.  \nSince December 2007, temporary help employment has declined by 686,000, \nor 27 percent.  In February, job declines also occurred in services to \nbuildings and dwellings (-17,000), architectural and engineering ser-\nvices (-16,000), and business support services (-12,000).\n\n   Widespread job losses continued in manufacturing in February (-168,000).  \nThe majority of the decline occurred in durable goods industries (-132,000), \nwith the largest decreases in fabricated metal products (-28,000) and ma-\nchinery (-25,000).  Employment in nondurable goods manufacturing declined \nby 36,000 over the month.\n\n   The construction industry lost 104,000 jobs in February.  Employment \nin the industry has fallen by 1.1 million since peaking in January 2007.  \nTwo-fifths of that decline occurred over the last 4 months.  Employment \nfell sharply in both the residential and nonresidential components of \nthe industry in February.\n\n   Employment in truck transportation declined by 33,000 in February; \nthe industry has lost 138,000 jobs since the start of the recession \nin December 2007.  Nearly two-thirds of the decline (-88,000) occurred\nover the last 4 months.  The information industry continued to lose\njobs (-15,000).  Over the last 4 months, employment in the industry\nhas decreased by 76,000, with about two-fifths of the decline occur-\nring in publishing.\n\n\n                               - 4 -\n\n   Employment in financial activities continued to decline in February\n(-44,000).  The number of jobs in this industry has dropped by 448,000\nsince an employment peak in December 2006, with half of this loss oc-\ncurring in the past 6 months.  In February, job losses occurred in real \nestate (-11,000); credit intermediation (-11,000); and securities, com-\nmodity contracts, and investments (-8,000).\n\n   Retail trade employment fell by 40,000 over the month and has declined \nby 608,000 since December 2007.  In February, employment decreased in auto-\nmobile dealerships (-9,000), sporting goods (-9,000), furniture and home \nfurnishing stores (-8,000), and building material and garden supply stores \n(-7,000).  Employment in wholesale trade fell by 37,000 over the month, \nwith nearly all of the decline occurring in durable goods.\n\n   Employment in leisure and hospitality continued to trend down over the \nmonth (-33,000), with about half of the decrease in the accommodation in-\ndustry (-18,000).\n\n   Health care continued to add jobs in February, with a gain of 27,000.  \nJob growth occurred in ambulatory health care (16,000) and in hospitals \n(7,000).\n\n   The change in total nonfarm employment for December was revised\nfrom -577,000 to -681,000 and the change for January was revised from\n-598,000 to -655,000.  Monthly revisions result from additional sample\nreports and the monthly recalculation of seasonal factors.\n\nWeekly Hours (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   In February, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory\nworkers on private nonfarm payrolls was 33.3 hours for the third month\nin a row.  Both the manufacturing workweek and factory overtime de-\ncreased by 0.2 hour over the month to 39.6 and 2.6 hours, respectively.  \n(See table B-2.)\n   \n   The index of aggregate weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory \nworkers on private nonfarm payrolls fell by 0.7 percent in February.  \nThe manufacturing index declined by 2.0 percent over the month.  (See \ntable B-5.)\n\nHourly and Weekly Earnings (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   In February, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory \nworkers on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 3 cents, or 0.2 percent, sea-\nsonally adjusted.  Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings in-\ncreased by 3.6 percent, and average weekly earnings rose by 2.1 percent.  \n(See table B-3.)\n\n                    ______________________________\n\n\n   The Employment Situation for March 2009 is scheduled to be released\non Friday, April 3, at 8:30 A.M.

Payroll employment has declined\nby 3.6 million since the start of the recession in December 2007; about one-\nhalf of this decline occurred in the past 3 months.  In January, job losses\nwere large and widespread across nearly all major industry sectors.\n\nUnemployment (Household Survey Data)\n\n   Both the number of unemployed persons (11.6 million) and the unemployment\nrate (7.6 percent) rose in January.  Over the past 12 months, the number of un-\nemployed persons has increased by 4.1 million and the unemployment rate has\nrisen by 2.7 percentage points.  (See table A-1.)\n\n   The unemployment rate continued to trend upward in January for adult men\n(7.6 percent), adult women (6.2 percent), whites (6.9 percent), blacks (12.6\npercent), and Hispanics (9.7 percent).  The jobless rate for teenagers was un-\nchanged at 20.8 percent.  The unemployment rate for Asians was 6.2 percent in\nJanuary, not seasonally adjusted.  (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\n   Among the unemployed, the number of job losers and persons who completed\ntemporary jobs increased to 7.0 million in January.  This measure has grown\nby 3.2 million during the last 12 months.  (See table A-8.)\n\n   The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more)\nwas little changed at 2.6 million in January.  Over the past 12 months, the\nnumber of long-term unemployed was up by 1.3 million.  The number of persons\nunemployed less than 5 weeks rose to 3.7 million in January.  (See table A-9.)\n\nTotal Employment and the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   The civilian labor force participation rate, at 65.5 percent in January, has\nedged down in recent months.  The employment-population ratio declined by 0.5\npercentage point to 60.5 percent over the month, and by 2.4 percentage points\nover the year.  (See table A-1.)\n\n   The number of persons who worked part time for economic reasons (sometimes\nreferred to as involuntary part-time workers) was essentially unchanged in\nJanuary at 7.8 million; however, this measure was up by 3.1 million over the\npast 12 months.  Included in this category are persons who would like to work\nfull time but were working part time because their hours had been cut back or\nbecause they were unable to find full-time jobs.  (See table A-5.)\n\nPersons Not in the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   About 2.1 million persons (not seasonally adjusted) were marginally attached\nto the labor force in January, about 400,000 more than 12 months earlier.  These\nindividuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime\nin the prior 12 months.  They were not counted as unemployed because they had not\nsearched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  Among the marginally at-\ntached, there were 734,000 discouraged workers in January, up by about 270,000\nfrom a year earlier.  Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for\nwork because they believe no jobs are available for them.  The other 1.4 million\npersons marginally attached to the labor force in January had not searched for\nwork in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance\nor family responsibilities.  (See table A-13.)\n\n\n    _____________________________________________________________________\n   |                                                                     |\n   |              Establishment and Household Data Changes               |\n   |                                                                     |\n   |   The establishment survey data in this release have been revised as|\n   |a result of the annual benchmarking process and the updating of sea- |\n   |sonal adjustment factors.

In\nJanuary, employment declined in nearly all major industries, while health\ncare and private education added jobs.  (See table B-1.)\n\n   Manufacturing employment fell by 207,000 in January, the largest 1-month\ndecline since October 1982.  In January, durable goods manufacturing lost\n157,000 jobs, with notable decreases in fabricated metal products (-37,000),\nmotor vehicles and parts (-31,000), and machinery (-22,000).  Employment in\nnondurable goods manufacturing declined by 50,000 over the month.\n\n   Construction lost 111,000 jobs in January.  Employment in the industry\nhas fallen by about 1.0 million since peaking in January 2007.

This month, the annual benchmarking process also con-\ntributed to these revisions.\n\nWeekly Hours (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   In January, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers on\nprivate nonfarm payrolls remained at 33.3 hours, seasonally adjusted.  Both the\nmanufacturing workweek and factory overtime decreased by 0.1 hour over the month,\nto 39.8 and 2.9 hours, respectively.  (See table B-2.)\n\n   The index of aggregate weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory workers on\nnonfarm payrolls fell by 0.7 percent in January.  The manufacturing index declined\nby 2.1 percent over the month.  (See table B-5.)\n\nHourly and Weekly Earnings (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   In January, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers\non private nonfarm payrolls rose by 5 cents, or 0.3 percent, seasonally adjusted.\nThis followed gains of 7 cents in December and 6 cents in November.  Over the past\n12 months, average hourly earnings increased by 3.9 percent, and average weekly\nearnings rose by 2.7 percent.

Population estimates for the household  |\n   |survey are developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.  Each year, the Census      |\n   |Bureau updates the estimates to reflect new information and assumptions     |\n   |about the growth of the population during the decade.  The change in popu-  |\n   |lation reflected in the new estimates results primarily from adjustments    |\n   |for net international migration, updated vital statistics information, and  |\n   |some methodological changes in the estimation process.                      |\n   |                                                                            |\n   |                                                                            |\n   |   In accordance with our usual practice, BLS will not revise the official  |\n   |household survey estimates for December 2008 and earlier months.  To show   |\n   |the impact of the population adjustment, however, differences in selected   |\n   |December 2008 labor force series based on the old and new population esti-  |\n   |mates are shown in table C.  The adjustment decreased the estimated size    |\n   |of the civilian noninstitutional population in December by 483,000, the     |\n   |civilian labor force by 449,000, and employment by 407,000; the new popula- |\n   |tion estimates had a negligible impact on unemployment rates and other per- |\n   |centage estimates.  Data users are cautioned that these annual population   |\n   |adjustments affect the comparability of household data series over time.    |\n   |Estimates of large levels such as total labor force and employment are im-  |\n   |pacted most.  Table D shows the effect of the introduction of new popula-   |\n   |tion estimates on the changes in selected labor force measures between      |\n   |December 2008 and January 2009.

Payroll employment fell by 524,000 over the \nmonth and by 1.9 million over the last 4 months of 2008.  In December, job losses \nwere large and widespread across most major industry sectors.\n   \nUnemployment (Household Survey Data)\n   \n   In December, the number of unemployed persons increased by 632,000 to 11.1 mil-\nlion and the unemployment rate rose to 7.2 percent.  Since the start of the reces-\nsion in December 2007, the number of unemployed persons has grown by 3.6 million, \nand the unemployment rate has risen by 2.3 percentage points.  (See table A-1.)\n   \n   The unemployment rates for adult men (7.2 percent), adult women (5.9 percent), \nand whites (6.6 percent) increased in December.  The jobless rates for teenagers \n(20.8 percent), blacks (11.9 percent), and Hispanics (9.2 percent) were little \nchanged over the month.  The unemployment rate for Asians was 5.1 percent in Decem-\nber, not seasonally adjusted. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n   \n   Among the unemployed, the number of job losers and persons who completed tempo-\nrary jobs rose by 315,000 to 6.5 million in December.  Over the past 12 months, the \nsize of this group has increased by 2.7 million.  (See table A-8.)  The number of \nlong-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) rose to 2.6 million in \nDecember and was up by 1.3 million in 2008.

adjusted household data have been revised.\nSee note on page 5. \n\n\n                                  - 3 -\n                                  \n                                  \nTotal Employment and the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n   \n   The civilian labor force (154.4 million) and the labor force participation rate \n(65.7 percent) were little changed in December.  The employment-population ratio fell \nby 0.4 percentage point to 61.0 percent over the month and by 1.7 percentage points \nin 2008.  (See table A-1.)\n   \n   In December, the number of persons who worked part time for economic reasons (some-\ntimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) continued to increase, reaching \n8.0 million.  The number of such workers rose by 3.4 million over the past 12 months.  \nThis category includes persons who would like to work full time but were working part \ntime because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find full-\ntime jobs.  (See table A-5.)\n   \nPersons Not in the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n   \n   About 1.9 million persons (not seasonally adjusted) were marginally attached to the\nlabor force in December, 564,000 more than 12 months earlier.  These individuals wanted \nand were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months.  \nThey were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks\npreceding the survey.  Among the marginally attached, there were 642,000 discouraged work-\ners in December, up by 279,000 from a year earlier.  Discouraged workers are persons not \ncurrently looking for work specifically because they believe no jobs are available for \nthem.  The other 1.3 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in December \nhad not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school \nattendance or family responsibilities.  (See table A-13.)\n\nIndustry Payroll Employment (Establishment Survey Data)\n   \n   Total nonfarm payroll employment declined sharply (-524,000) in December.  Over the \npast 4 months, payroll employment has fallen by 1.9 million, or 1.4 percent.  In Decem-\nber, large job losses continued in manufacturing, construction, and employment services, \nwhile health care continued to add jobs.  (See table B-1.)\n   \n   Manufacturing employment fell by 149,000 in December, the largest over-the-month de-\ncline since August 2001.  Factory job losses totaled 791,000 in 2008, with nearly half \nof the decrease occurring in the fourth quarter.  In December, declines were widespread \namong the component industries.  The largest job losses occurred in fabricated metal \nproducts (-28,000) and motor vehicles and parts (-21,000).\n   \n   Employment in construction continued to decline (-101,000) in December and has fallen \nby 899,000 since peaking in September 2006.  Over the month, job losses occurred through-\nout the industry.\n   \n   Within professional and business services, the temporary help industry lost 81,000 \njobs in December, bringing job losses in 2008 to 490,000.  In December, employment \nalso fell in the management of companies and enterprises (-8,000) and in architectural \nand engineering services (-7,000).\n   \n   Employment in retail trade declined by 67,000 in December and by 522,000 for all of \n2008.  More than half of the losses in 2008 occurred in the last 4 months of the year.  \nIn December, employment decreased in automobile dealerships (-22,000), furniture and \nhome furnishing stores (-8,000), and electronics and appliance stores (-5,000).  Whole-\nsale trade employment fell by 30,000 over the month and by 164,000 in 2008.\n   \n                                  - 4 -          \n                                  \n   Elsewhere in the service-providing sector, employment in transportation and ware-\nhousing declined by 24,000 in December, with losses in truck transportation (-16,000) \nand air transportation (-4,000).  The information industry lost 20,000 jobs over the \nmonth.  Food services employment continued to trend downward (-20,000) and has de-\ncreased by 104,000 since its recent peak in June 2008.  Employment in financial\nactivities edged down in December and fell by 148,000 in 2008.\n   \n   Health care employment continued to grow in December (32,000), with over-the-month \njob gains in ambulatory services (14,000) and hospitals (12,000).  In 2008, health care\nadded 372,000 jobs.\n   \n   The change in total nonfarm employment for October was revised from -320,000 to \n-423,000, and the change for November was revised from -533,000 to -584,000.  Monthly \nrevisions result from additional sample reports and the monthly recalculation of sea-\nsonal factors.\n   \nWeekly Hours (Establishment Survey Data)\n   \n   In December, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers on pri-\nvate nonfarm payrolls fell by 0.2 hour to 33.3 hours, seasonally adjusted--the lowest \nlevel on record for the series, which began in 1964.  The manufacturing workweek, at \n39.9 hours, declined by 0.4 hour over the month, and factory overtime, at 3.0 hours, \ndeclined by 0.3 hour.  (See table B-2.)\n   \n   The index of aggregate weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory workers on \nprivate nonfarm payrolls fell by 1.1 percent in December and 4.0 percent since peaking \nin December 2007.  The manufacturing index declined by 2.4 percent over the month.  \n(See table B-5.)\n   \nHourly and Weekly Earnings (Establishment Survey Data)\n   \n   In December, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers on \nprivate nonfarm payrolls rose by 5 cents, or 0.3 percent, seasonally adjusted.  This \nfollowed gains of 8 cents in November and 6 cents in October.  For all of 2008, average \nhourly earnings increased by 3.7 percent and average weekly earnings rose by 2.2 percent.  \n(See table B-3.)\n   \n                     ______________________________\n   \n   \n   The Employment Situation for January 2009 is scheduled to be released on Friday, Feb-\nruary 6, at 8:30 A.M.

As a result of this\nprocess, seasonally adjusted data for January 2004-November 2008 were\nsubject to revision.\n   \n   Table B shows the unemployment rates for January to November 2008, as\nfirst published and as revised.  The rates were unchanged in 5 of the 11\nmonths and changed by one-tenth of a percentage point in the remaining 6\nmonths.

November's\ndrop in payroll employment followed declines of 403,000 in September and\n320,000 in October, as revised.  Job losses were large and widespread\nacross the major industry sectors in November.\n\nUnemployment (Household Survey Data)\n\n   Both the number of unemployed persons (10.3 million) and the unemploy-\nment rate (6.7 percent) continued to increase in November.  Since the start \nof the recession in December 2007, as recently announced by the National \nBureau of Economic Research, the number of unemployed persons increased by \n2.7 million, and the unemployment rate rose by 1.7 percentage points.  (See \ntable A-1.)\n\n   The unemployment rates for adult men (6.5 percent) and adult women (5.5 \npercent) continued to trend up in November.  The unemployment rates for \nteenagers (20.4 percent), whites (6.1 percent), blacks (11.2 percent), and \nHispanics (8.6 percent) showed little change over the month.  The jobless \nrate for Asians was 4.8 percent in November, not seasonally adjusted.  (See \ntables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\n   Among the unemployed, the number of persons who lost their job and did not \nexpect to be recalled to work increased by 298,000 to 4.7 million in November.  \nOver the past 12 months, the size of this group has increased by 2.0 million.  \n(See table A-8.)\n   \n   The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was \nlittle changed at 2.2 million in November, but was up by 822,000 over the past \n12 months.  (See table A-9.)\n\nTotal Employment and the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   In November, the labor force participation rate declined by 0.3 percentage \npoint to 65.8 percent.  Total employment continued to decline, and the employ-\nment-population ratio fell to 61.4 percent.  (See table A-1.)\n   \n   Over the month, the number of persons who worked part time for economic \nreasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) continued \nto increase, reaching 7.3 million.  The number of such workers rose by 2.8 \nmillion over the past 12 months.  This category includes persons who would \nlike to work full time but were working part time because their hours had \nbeen cut back or because they were unable to find full-time jobs.

584,000 more than 12 months\nearlier.  These individuals wanted and were available for work and had\nlooked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months.  They were not counted\nas unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks pre-\nceding the survey.  Among the marginally attached, there were 608,000 dis-\ncouraged workers in November, up by 259,000 from a year earlier.  Discour-\naged workers are persons not currently looking for work specifically be-\ncause they believe no jobs are available for them.  The other 1.3 million \npersons marginally attached to the labor force in November had not searched \nfor work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school \nattendance or family responsibilities.  (See table A-13.)\n\nIndustry Payroll Employment (Establishment Survey Data)\n   \n   Total nonfarm payroll employment fell by 533,000 in November, bringing\nlosses to 1. 9 million since the start of the recession in December 2007.\nTwo-thirds of these losses occurred in the last 3 months.  In November,\nemployment declined in nearly all major industries, although health care\ncontinued to add jobs.  (See table B-1.)\n\n   In November, employment continued to decline in manufacturing (-85,000), \nwith widespread job losses occurring among the component industries.  Manu-\nfacturing employment has declined by 604,000 since December.  Within dur-\nable goods manufacturing, job losses occurred in November in fabricated \nmetal products (-15,000), machinery (-11,000), wood products (-9,000), \nfurniture and related products (-7,000), primary metals (-7,000), and com-\nputer and electronic products (-7,000).  Employment in transportation \nequipment edged up, as a return of 27,000 aerospace workers from strike \nmore than offset a job loss in motor vehicle and parts (-13,000).  In the \nnondurable goods component, job losses occurred in plastics and rubber \nproducts (-12,000), printing and related support activities (-5,000), and \ntextile mills (-5,000).\n   \n   Employment in construction fell by 82,000 in November, with losses oc-\ncurring throughout the industry.  Since peaking in September 2006, con-\nstruction employment has decreased by 780,000.  Specialty trade contrac-\ntors lost 50,000 jobs in November, with both residential and nonresiden-\ntial components contributing to the decline.\n   \n   Within professional and business services, the employment services\nindustry lost 101,000 jobs over the month, bringing total job losses\nsince December to 495,000.  In November, employment fell by 10,000 in\narchitectural and engineering services.\n   \n   Employment in retail trade fell by 91,000 in November.  Job losses\ncontinued in automobile dealerships (-24,000).  Employment in the indus-\ntry has fallen by 115,000 since December, with much of the decrease oc-\ncurring over the last 2 months.  In several other retail industries, sea-\nsonal hiring for the holidays fell short of normal in November.  After\nseasonal adjustment, employment declined in clothing and accessories\nstores (-18,000); sporting goods, hobby, book, and music stores (-11,000); \nand furniture and home furnishing stores (-10,000).  Wholesale trade em-\nployment was down by 25,000 over the month, with most of the decrease \namong durable goods wholesalers.\n   \n   Employment in leisure and hospitality declined by 76,000 in November,\nwith most of the decline occurring in accommodation and food services \n(-54,000).  Since peaking in April 2008, accommodation and food services\nhas lost 150,000 jobs.\n\n\n                                 - 4 -\n\n\n   In November, employment in financial activities continued to decline \n(-32,000).  Within the industry, job losses occurred in credit intermedi-\nation and related activities (-16,000) and in rental and leasing services \n(-9,000).  Job losses in financial activities have accelerated over the \nlast 3 months, bringing the total decline since December to 142,000.\n   \n   Elsewhere in the service-providing sector, employment in transporta-\ntion and warehousing declined by 32,000 in November, with most of the \nlosses in truck transportation (-12,000) and couriers and messengers\n(-8,000).  The information industry lost 19,000 jobs over the month.\n   \n   Health care employment grew by 34,000 in November.  Over the past 12\nmonths, health care has added 369,000 jobs.\n   \n   The change in total nonfarm employment for September was revised from\n-284,000 to -403,000, and the change for October was revised from -240,000 \nto -320,000.  In both months, there were large revisions in most of the \nmajor industry sectors.  These revisions resulted primarily because of the \nnormal monthly recalculation of seasonal factors rather than the incorpora-\ntion of additional sample reports.\n   \nWeekly Hours (Establishment Survey Data)\n   \n   In November, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory\nworkers on private nonfarm payrolls fell by 0.1 hour to 33.5 hours, sea-\nsonally adjusted--the lowest in the history of the series, which began\nin 1964.  Both the manufacturing workweek and factory overtime fell by\n0.2 hour over the month, to 40.3 and 3.3 hours, respectively.  (See \ntable B-2.)\n   \n   The index of aggregate weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory\nworkers on nonfarm payrolls fell by 0.9 percent in November.  The manu-\nfacturing index declined by 1.4 percent.  (See table B-5.)\n   \nHourly and Weekly Earnings (Establishment Survey Data)\n   \n   In November, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory\nworkers on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 7 cents, or 0.4 percent.  This \nfollowed gains of 6 cents in October and 3 cents in September.  Over the \npast 12 months, average hourly earnings increased by 3.7 percent, and\naverage weekly earnings rose by 2.8 percent.  (See table B-3.)\n\n   \n                     ______________________________\n\n   \n   The Employment Situation for December 2008 is scheduled to be released\non Friday, January 9, 2009, at 8:30 A.M.

October's drop in payroll employment followed declines of \n127,000 in August and 284,000 in September, as revised.  Employment has fallen by \n1.2 million in the first 10 months of 2008; over half of the decrease has occurred \nin the past 3 months.  In October, job losses continued in manufacturing, construc-\ntion, and several service-providing industries.  Health care and mining continued \nto add jobs.\n\nUnemployment (Household Survey Data)\n\n   The unemployment rate rose by 0.4 percentage point to 6.5 percent in October, \nand the number of unemployed persons increased by 603,000 to 10.1 million.  Over \nthe past 12 months, the number of unemployed persons has increased by 2.8 mil-\nlion, and the unemployment rate has risen by 1.7 percentage points.  (See \ntable A-1.)\n\n   The unemployment rates for adult men (6.3 percent), adult women (5.3 percent), \nwhites (5.9 percent), and Hispanics (8.8 percent) rose in October.  The jobless \nrates for teenagers (20.6 percent) and blacks (11.1 percent) were little changed.  \nThe unemployment rate for Asians in October was 3.8 percent, not seasonally ad-\njusted.  (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\n   Among the unemployed, the number of persons who lost their job and did not ex-\npect to be recalled to work rose by 615,000 to 4.4 million in October.  Over the \npast 12 months, the size of this group has increased by 1.7 million.  (See \ntable A-8.)\n\n   In October, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or \nmore) rose by 249,000 to 2.3 million.  The long-term unemployed accounted for \n22.3 percent of total unemployment.  The newly unemployed--those who were jobless \nfewer than 5 weeks--increased by 212,000 to 3.1 million in October.  (See \ntable A-9.)\n\nTotal Employment and the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   The civilian labor force participation rate (66.1 percent) and the employment-\npopulation ratio (61.8 percent) were little changed in October.  Since a recent \nhigh in December 2006, the employment-population ratio has declined by 1.6 per-\ncentage points.  (See table A-1.)\n\n\n                                     - 2 -\n\n\nTable A.

           \n   3 Data relate to private production and nonsupervisory workers.              \n   p = preliminary.                                                             \n\n\n                                    - 3 -\n\n\n   In October, the number of persons who worked part time for economic reasons \n(sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) rose by 645,000 to 6.7 \nmillion.  The number of such workers increased by 2.3 million over the past 12 \nmonths.  This category includes persons who would like to work full time but were \nworking part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were un-\nable to find full-time jobs.  (See table A-5.)\n\nPersons Not in the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   About 1.6 million persons (not seasonally adjusted) were marginally attached \nto the labor force in October, 273,000 more than 12 months earlier.  These indi-\nviduals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in \nthe prior 12 months.  They are not counted as unemployed because they had not \nsearched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  Among the marginally at-\ntached, there were 484,000 discouraged workers in October; the number of dis-\ncouraged workers was 164,000 higher than a year earlier.  Discouraged workers are \npersons not currently looking for work specifically because they believe no jobs \nare available for them.  The other 1.2 million persons marginally attached to the \nlabor force in October had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the sur-\nvey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.  (See \ntable A-13.)\n\nIndustry Payroll Employment (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   Total nonfarm payroll employment fell by 240,000 in October, bringing job losses \nthus far in 2008 to 1.2 million.  Over the month, employment declines continued in \nmanufacturing, construction, and several service-providing industries, while health \ncare and mining again added jobs.  (See table B-1.)\n\n   Manufacturing employment declined by 90,000 over the month.  Some 27,000 aero-\nspace workers in the transportation equipment industry were off payrolls in October \ndue to a strike; taking the strike into account, factory job losses in October were \nabout in line with the prior 2 months.  Within durable goods manufacturing, employ-\nment declined in fabricated metal products (-11,000), furniture and related products \n(-10,000), motor vehicles and parts (-9,000), wood products (-7,000), and computer \nand electronic products (-4,000).  In the nondurable goods component, job losses \noccurred in plastics and rubber products (-6,000), apparel (-4,000), and printing \nand related support activities (-4,000).\n\n   Construction employment fell by 49,000 in October, with declines throughout the \nindustry.  Since peaking in September 2006, construction employment has fallen by \n663,000, largely in the residential components.\n\n   Within professional and business services, the employment services industry shed \n51,000 jobs in October.  The pace of job loss in this industry has picked up in 2008, \naveraging 37,000 per month through October; in 2007, monthly job losses averaged \n11,000 in employment services.\n\n   Retail trade employment fell by 38,000 in October, with the largest losses occur-\nring among automobile dealers (-20,000) and department stores (-18,000).  Wholesale \ntrade employment was down by 22,000 over the month, with most of the decrease among \ndurable goods wholesalers.\n\n   Employment in financial activities declined by 24,000 in October and is down \nby 200,000 since its peak in December 2006.  Over the month, employment contracted \nin both credit intermediation and related activities (-12,000) and in securities \nand investment firms (-6,000).\n\n   Health care employment continued to expand in October, with an increase of \n26,000.  Over the past 12 months, health care employment has grown by 348,000.  \nThe mining industry added 7,000 jobs in October.  Since a low in April 2003, min-\ning employment has grown by 246,000.\n\n\n                                    - 4 -\n\n\nWeekly Hours (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   In October, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers on \nprivate nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 33.6 hours.  The manufacturing workweek \nand factory overtime also were unchanged over the month at 40.6 and 3.6 hours, \nrespectively.  (See table B-2.)\n\n   The index of aggregate weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory workers on \nprivate nonfarm payrolls declined by 0.3 percent in October.  The manufacturing in-\ndex fell by 1.0 percent.  (See table B-5.)\n\nHourly and Weekly Earnings (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   In October, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers on \nprivate nonfarm payrolls increased by 4 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $18.21, seasonally \nadjusted.  Average weekly earnings were $611.86.  Over the past 12 months, average \nhourly earnings increased by 3.5 percent and average weekly earnings rose by 2.9 \npercent.

Employment \ncontinued to fall in construction, manufacturing, and retail trade,  \nwhile mining and health care \ncontinued to add jobs.\n\nUnemployment (Household Survey Data)\n\n   The unemployment rate (6.1 percent) was unchanged in September,\nfollowing a 0.4 percentage point rise in August.  The number of\nunemployed persons was little changed at 9.5 million.  Over the past\n12 months, the number of unemployed persons has increased by 2.2 mil-\nlion and the unemployment rate has risen by 1.4 percentage points.\n(See table A-1.)\n   \n   The unemployment rates for adult men (6.1 percent) and blacks (11.4\npercent) rose in September.  The jobless rates for teenagers (19.1 per-\ncent), whites (5.4 percent), and Hispanics (7.8 percent) were essen-\ntially unchanged.  The unemployment rate for adult women declined  to \n4.9 percent, partly offsetting an increase in August.  The unemploy-\nment rate for Asians in September was 3.8 percent, not seasonally ad-\njusted.  (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n   \n   In September, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for\n27 weeks or more) rose by 167,000 to 2.0 million, an increase of 728,000 \nover the past 12 months.  The long-term unemployed accounted for 21.1 per-\ncent of total unemployment in September.  (See table A-9.)\n   \nTotal Employment and the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n   \n   The civilian labor force (154.7 million) and the labor force parti-\ncipation rate (66.0 percent) were essentially unchanged over the month.  \nTotal employment (145.3 million) and the employment-population ratio \n(62.0 percent) were little changed.  Since a recent high in December \n2006, the employment-population ratio has declined by 1.4 percentage \npoints.  (See table A-1.)\n   \n   The number of persons who worked part time for economic reasons\nrose by 337,000 to 6.1 million in September, an increase of 1.6 mil-\nlion over the past 12 months.  This category includes persons who\nwould like to work full time but were working part time because their\nhours had been cut back or because they were unable to find full-time\njobs.

(See table A-6.)\n\nPersons Not in the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   About 1.6 million persons (not seasonally adjusted) were marginally\nattached to the labor force in September, 336,000 more than 12 months\nearlier.  These individuals wanted and were available for work and had\nlooked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months.  They are not count-\ned as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks \npreceding the survey.  Among the marginally attached, there were 467,000 \ndiscouraged workers in September; the number of discouraged workers has \nincreased by 191,000 from a year earlier.  Discouraged workers are per-\nsons not currently looking for work specifically because they believe \nno jobs are available for them.  The other 1.1 million persons margin-\nally attached to the labor force in September had not searched for work \nin the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school atten-\ndance or family responsibilities.  (See table A-13.)\n\nIndustry Payroll Employment (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   Total nonfarm payroll employment decreased by 159,000 in September.\nThus far in 2008, payroll employment has fallen by 760,000.  Over the\nmonth, employment continued to decline in manufacturing, construction, \nand retail trade.  Health care and mining continued to add jobs in \nSeptember.  (See table B-1.)\n   \n   Manufacturing employment fell by 51,000 over the month, bringing\nthe decline in factory jobs to 442,000 over the past 12 months.  In \nSeptember, job losses continued in motor vehicles and parts (-18,000); \nthis industry has shed 140,000 jobs over the past 12 months.  Else-\nwhere among durable goods manufacturers, employment decreased in fab-\nricated metals (- 7,000), wood products (-5,000), and furniture and \nrelated products (-5,000).

The\nfinal benchmark revision will be issued on February 6, 2009, with the\npublication of the January 2009 Employment Situation news release.\n   \n   Each year, the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey employ-\nment estimates are benchmarked to comprehensive counts of employment \nfor the month of March derived from state unemployment insurance tax \nrecords that nearly all employers are required to file. For national \nCES employment series, the annual benchmark revisions over the last \n10 years have averaged plus or minus two-tenths of one percent at the \ntotal nonfarm level.  The preliminary estimate of the benchmark revi-\nsion shows that there was an accumulated overstatement of CES employ-\nment between March 2007 and March 2008 of 21,000 (0.02 percent of total \nnonfarm employment in March 2008).\n   \n   Table B shows the March 2008 preliminary benchmark revisions by\nmajor industry sector.  As is typically the case, many of the individ-\nual industry series show larger percentage revisions than the total \nnonfarm series, primarily because statistical sampling error is greater \nat more detailed levels than at a total level.  \n\n\n\nTable B.

Over the last \n4 months, the number of unemployed job losers has increased by 810,000.  (See \ntable A-8.)\n   \n   In August, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or \nmore) rose by 163,000 to 1.8 million, an increase of 589,000 over the past 12 \nmonths.  The newly unemployed--those who were jobless fewer than 5 weeks--\nincreased by 400,000 over the month.  (See table A-9.)\n\nTotal Employment and the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   The civilian labor force, at 154.9 million, was about unchanged in August, \nand the labor force participation rate remained at 66.1 percent.  Total employ-\nment, at 145.5 million, was little changed from July.  The employment-population \nratio fell over the month to 62.1 percent in August, down 1.3 percentage points \nfrom its most recent high of 63.4 percent in December 2006.  (See table A-1.)\n\n   In August, the number of persons who worked part time for economic reasons \nwas essentially unchanged at 5.7 million.  This category includes persons who \nindicated that they would like to work full time but were working part time \nbecause their hours had been cut back or they were unable to find full-time jobs.  \n(See table A-5.)\n\n   The number of multiple jobholders increased by 298,000 in August to 8.1 million, \naccounting for 5.5 percent of total employed.

They were not counted as unemployed because \nthey had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  Among the \nmarginally attached, there were 381,000 discouraged workers in August, little \nchanged from a year earlier.  Discouraged workers are persons not currently \nlooking for work specifically because they believe no jobs are available for them.  \nThe other 1.3 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in August \nhad not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such \nas school attendance or family responsibilities.

In August, employment also fell in 2 industries \nrelated to home building--wood products (-7,000) and furniture and related \nproducts (-7,000).  Computer and electronic products manufacturing added \n5,000 jobs over the month.\n   \n   Within professional and business services, employment services lost 53,000 \njobs in August; more than two-thirds of the decrease (-37,000) occurred in \ntemporary help services.  Since its most recent peak in August 2006, employ-\nment services has lost 419,000 jobs.\n\n   Employment in both wholesale and retail trade continued to trend down over \nthe month.  Within retail trade, motor vehicle and parts dealers shed 14,000 \njobs.

Over the past 12 months, health care has added \n367,000 jobs.\n   \n   Employment in mining increased by 12,000 in August, with gains occurring in \nall the component industries.  Over the past 12 months, job growth has been \nespecially strong in support activities for mining (39,000) and in oil and \ngas extraction (17,000).\n   \n   Construction job losses in July and August averaged 14,000, compared with \nan average monthly loss of 45,000 during the first half of 2008.

adjusted) were marginally at-\ntached to the labor force in July, an increase of 197,000 over the past 12 \nmonths.  These individuals wanted and were available for work and had looked \nfor a job sometime in the prior 12 months.  They were not counted as unemployed \nbecause they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  \nAmong the marginally attached, there were 461,000 discouraged workers in July, \n94,000 more than a year earlier.  Discouraged workers were not currently look-\ning for work specifically because they believed no jobs were available for them.  \nThe other 1.1 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in July had \nnot searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as\nschool attendance or family responsibilities.  (See table A-13.)\n\nIndustry Payroll Employment (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   Total nonfarm payroll employment continued to trend down (-51,000) in July.  \nThus far in 2008, payroll employment has fallen by 463,000.  Over the month, \nemployment continued to decline in manufacturing, construction, employment ser-\nvices, wholesale trade, and the information industry.  Health care and mining \ncontinued to add jobs over the month.  (See table B-1.)\n\n   Manufacturing employment fell by 35,000 in July, bringing losses over the past \n12 months to 383,000.  Over the month, job losses were widespread with notable de-\nclines in transportation equipment (-8,000), wood products (-4,000), and textile \nmills (-3,000).  Machinery added 6,000 jobs over the month.\n   \n   Employment in construction was down by 22,000 in July.  Construction has shed \n557,000 jobs since its September 2006 employment peak, with nearly three-quarters \nof the decline occurring since October 2007.  Nearly all of the July employment \ndecrease came among specialty trade contractors (-20,000), with both the residen-\ntial and nonresidential components contributing to the decline.\n   \n   Within professional and business services, employment services lost 34,000 jobs \nin July, with nearly all of the decline in temporary help services (-29,000).  Since \nJanuary 2008, employment in temporary help services has declined by 185,000.  Com-\nputer systems design and related services added 7,000 jobs in July.\n\n   Wholesale trade employment decreased by 17,000 over the month, with declines in \nboth the durable and nondurable components.  Since its peak in November 2007, whole-\nsale trade has lost 57,000 jobs.\n\n   Employment in the information industry declined by 13,000 in July and by 44,000 \nover the past 12 months.  Telecommunications lost 5,000 jobs in July.\n\n   Over the month, employment in retail trade continued to trend down.  Since its \npeak in March 2007, retail trade has lost 211,000 jobs.  Employment in motor vehi-\ncle and parts dealers fell by 11,000 in July, bringing declines in that industry to \n35,000 since January 2008.\n\n\n\n                                  - 4 -\n                                  \n   Employment in health care continued to increase with a gain of 33,000 in July.  \nThis industry has added 368,000 jobs over the past 12 months.  In July, there were \njob gains of 21,000 in ambulatory health care services and 10,000 in hospitals.\n\n   In July, employment continued to grow in mining (10,000).  Mining employment has \nexpanded by 222,000, or 45 percent, since reaching a low in April 2003.  Most of this \nincrease has occurred in oil and gas extraction and in support activities for this \nindustry.\n\nWeekly Hours (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   In July, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers on pri-\nvate nonfarm payrolls fell by 0.1 hour to 33.6 hours, seasonally adjusted.  Both the \nmanufacturing workweek and factory overtime were unchanged over the month at 41.0 and \n3.8 hours, respectively.  (See table B-2.)\n     \n   The index of aggregate weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory workers on \nnonfarm payrolls fell by 0.4 percent in July to 106.6 (2002=100).  The manufacturing \nindex decreased by 0.1 percent to 91.6.  (See table B-5.)\n\nHourly and Weekly Earnings (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   In July, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers on pri-\nvate nonfarm payrolls rose by 6 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $18.06, seasonally adjusted.  \nThis followed gains of 6 cents in May and 5 cents in June.  Average weekly earnings, \nat $606.82, were about unchanged in July.  Over the past 12 months, average hourly \nearnings increased by 3.4 percent and average weekly earnings rose by 2.8 percent.  \n(See tables B-3 and B-4.)\n\n                             ______________________________\n   \n   \n   The Employment Situation for August 2008 is scheduled to be released on Friday, \nSeptember 5, at 8:30 A.M.

Employment continued to fall in\nconstruction, manufacturing, and employment services, while health care and\nmining added jobs.  Average hourly earnings rose by 6 cents, or 0.3 percent,\nover the month.\n\nUnemployment (Household Survey Data)\n\n   The number of unemployed persons was essentially unchanged in June, at\n8.5 million, and the unemployment rate held at 5.5 percent.  A year earlier,\nthe number of unemployed persons was 7.0 million, and the jobless rate was\n4.6 percent.  (See table A-1.)\n\n   The unemployment rate for Hispanics (7.7 percent) increased over the month,\nwhile the rate for adult men (5.1 percent) continued to trend up.  Jobless\nrates for adult women (4.7 percent), teenagers (18.1 percent), whites (4.9 per-\ncent), and blacks (9.2 percent) showed little or no change in June.  The unem-\nployment rate for Asians was 4.5 percent, not seasonally adjusted.  (See tables\nA-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\n   Among the unemployed, the number of persons who had lost their last job was\nessentially unchanged at 4.4 million in June, but has risen by 952,000 over the\npast 12 months.  The numbers of unemployed reentrants and new entrants to the\nlabor force were little changed in June; both groups had increased sharply in\nMay.  (See table A-8.)\n\n   Following a large increase in May, the number of newly unemployed--those job-\nless fewer than 5 weeks--decreased by 532,000 in June.  The number of persons un-\nemployed 5 to 14 weeks rose by 530,000 over the month.  The number of long-term\nunemployed (those persons jobless for 27 weeks or more) was essentially unchanged\nin June at 1.6 million; this group accounted for 18.4 percent of the unemployed.\n(See table A-9.)\n\n\n                                   - 2 -\n\n\nTable A.

(154.4 million) and the labor force participation\nrate (66.1 percent) were little changed in June; in the prior month the civil-\nian labor force had increased sharply.  Both total employment (145.9 million)\nand the employment-population ratio (62.4 percent) were essentially unchanged in\nJune.  The employment-population ratio was 0.6 percentage point lower than a year\nearlier.  (See table A-1.)\n\n   The number of persons who worked part time for economic reasons, at 5.4 million\nin June, was about unchanged over the month, but was up by 1.1 million over the\npast 12 months.  These individuals indicated that they were working part time be-\ncause their hours had been cut back or they were unable to find full-time jobs.\n(See table A-5.)\n\nPersons Not in the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   In June, about 1.6 million persons (not seasonally adjusted) were marginally\nattached to the labor force, little different from a year earlier.  These indi-\nviduals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in\nthe prior 12 months.  They were not counted as unemployed because they had not\nsearched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  Among the marginally at-\ntached, there were 420,000 discouraged workers in June, little changed from a year\nearlier.  Discouraged workers were not currently looking for work specifically be-\ncause they believed no jobs were available for them.  The other 1.1 million per-\nsons marginally attached to the labor force in June had not searched for work in\nthe 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family\nresponsibilities.  (See table A-13.)\n\nIndustry Payroll Employment (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   Total nonfarm payroll employment continued to trend down in June (-62,000).\nSince peaking in December 2007, payroll employment has fallen by 438,000.  In \nJune, job losses continued in construction, manufacturing, and employment ser-\nvices.  Health care and mining added jobs over the month.  (See table B-1.)\n\n   Employment in construction fell by 43,000 in June, as job losses continued\nacross the industry.  Since its peak in September 2006, construction employment\nhas fallen by 528,000.\n\n   In June, manufacturing employment fell by 33,000.  Job losses were wide-\nspread throughout the industry, with notable declines in fabricated metal pro-\nducts (-9,000), printing and related support activities (-6,000), and wood pro-\nducts (-6,000).  Employment in motor vehicles and parts edged up by 6,000 over\nthe month, largely reflecting the return of workers from strikes and related shut-\ndowns.  Over the past 12 months, manufacturing has lost 353,000 jobs.\n\n   Within professional and business services, employment services lost 59,000 jobs\nin June; about half of the decrease (-30,000) occurred in temporary help services.\nSo far this year, monthly job losses in temporary help services have averaged 26,000\ncompared with average declines of 7,000 per month in 2007.\n\n   Retail trade employment changed little in June.  A job gain in general merchan-\ndise stores (9,000) was offset by small declines elsewhere in the sector.  Since its\nmost recent peak in March 2007, retail trade has shed 194,000 jobs.\n\n\n                                   - 4 -\n\n\n   Employment in mining rose by 8,000 in June.  Support activities for mining and\noil and gas extraction accounted for most of the increase. Mining employment has ex-\npanded by 208,000, or 42 percent, since its most recent low in April 2003.\n\n   Health care employment continued to grow in June (15,000), although the increase\nwas half the size of the average monthly gain during the prior 12 months.  In June,\nemployment rose in ambulatory health care services (13,000).  Since June 2007, health\ncare has added 348,000 jobs.\n   In June, food services employment continued to trend upward (16,000), although job\ngains in this industry have slowed recently.  The industry added an average of 13,000\njobs per month from November 2007 through June 2008; this compares with an average in-\ncrease of 27,000 jobs per month for the first 10 months of 2007.\n\n   Government employment continued to trend up in June and has grown by 257,000 over\nthe past 12 months.  Local government has accounted for about two-thirds of the growth\nsince June 2007.\n\nWeekly Hours (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   In June, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers on private\nnonfarm payrolls remained at 33.7 hours, seasonally adjusted.  The manufacturing work-\nweek decreased by 0.1 hour to 40.8 hours, and factory overtime was unchanged at 3.9\nhours.  (See table B-2.)\n\n   The index of aggregate weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory workers on\nnonfarm payrolls fell by 0.1 percent in June to 107.0 (2002=100).  The manufacturing\nindex declined by 0.5 percent to 91.4 percent.  (See table B-5.)\n\nHourly and Weekly Earnings (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   In June, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers on pri-\nvate nonfarm payrolls rose by 6 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $18.01, seasonally adjusted.\nThis followed gains of 6 cents in May and 2 cents in April.  Average weekly earnings\nrose by 0.3 percent in June to $606.94.  Over the past 12 months, average hourly\nearnings increased by 3.4 percent and average weekly earnings rose by 2.8 percent.\n(See tables B-3 and B-4.)\n\n\n                    ______________________________\n\n\n   The Employment Situation for July 2008 is scheduled to be released on\nFriday, August 1, at 8:30 A.M.

In May, employ-\nment continued to fall in construction, manufacturing, retail trade, and\ntemporary help services, while health care continued to add jobs.  Average\nhourly earnings rose by 5 cents, or 0.3 percent, over the month.\n\nUnemployment (Household Survey Data)\n\n   The number of unemployed persons increased by 861,000 to 8.5 million in\nMay, after seasonal adjustment, and the unemployment rate rose by 0.5 per-\ncentage point to 5.5 percent.  A year earlier, the number of unemployed per-\nsons was 6.9 million, and the jobless rate was 4.5 percent.  (See table A-1.)\n\n   The unemployment rates for adult men (4.9 percent), adult women (4.8 per-\ncent), teenagers (18.7 percent), whites (4.9 percent), and blacks (9.7 per-\ncent) rose in May.  The jobless rate for Hispanics (6.9 percent) was unchanged.\nThe unemployment rate for Asians was 3.8 percent, not seasonally adjusted.\n(See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\n   Among the unemployed, the number of reentrants and new entrants to the\nlabor force rose in May, by 326,000 and 204,000, respectively. The number of\npersons who had lost their last job increased by 268,000 over the month to\n4.3 million.  Over the past 12 months, the number of unemployed job losers has\nrisen by 907,000. (See table A-8.)\n\n   The number of newly unemployed--those jobless fewer than 5 weeks--rose by\n760,000 to 3.2 million in May.  The number of persons unemployed for 27 weeks\nor more increased by 197,000 to 1.6 million.  This group accounted for 18.3 per-\ncent of the unemployed in May.  (See table A-9.)\n\nTotal Employment and the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   The civilian labor force rose by 577,000 to 154.5 million in May, and the\nlabor force participation rate edged up to 66.2 percent.  Total employment was\nlittle changed at 146.0 million.  The employment-population ratio, at 62.6 per-\ncent, also was little changed over the month.  (See table A-1.)\n\n   The number of persons who worked part time for economic reasons, at 5.2 mil-\nlion in May, was essentially unchanged over the month but was up by 764,000 over\nthe past 12 months.  These individuals indicated that they were working part time\nbecause their hours had been cut back or they were unable to find full-time jobs.\n(See table A-5.)\n\n   About 7.7 million persons held more than one job in May.  Multiple jobholders\nrepresented 5.3 percent of the employed, the same as a year earlier.  (See table\nA-6.)\n\n\n\n                                   - 2 -\n\n\n\nTable A.

force, about the same as a year earlier.  These individ-\nuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in\nthe prior 12 months.  They were not counted as unemployed because they had not\nsearched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  Among the marginally\nattached, there were 400,000 discouraged workers in May, little changed from a\nyear earlier.  Discouraged workers were not currently looking for work specif-\nically because they believed no jobs were available for them.  The other\n1.0 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in May had not\nsearched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as\nschool attendance or family responsibilities.  (See table A-13.)\n\nIndustry Payroll Employment (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   Total nonfarm payroll employment continued to trend down in May (-49,000).\nThus far in 2008, payroll employment has declined by 324,000.  In May, job\nlosses continued in construction, manufacturing, retail trade, and temporary\nhelp services.  Health care again added jobs over the month.  (See table B-1.)\n\n   Employment in construction fell by 34,000 in May.  Since an employment peak\nin September 2006, construction has lost 475,000 jobs.

The unem-\nployment rate, at 5.0 percent, also was little changed in April.  Employment\ncontinued to decline in construction, manufacturing, and retail trade, while\njobs were added in health care and in professional and technical services.\n\nUnemployment (Household Survey Data)\n\n   The number of unemployed persons (7.6 million) and the unemployment rate\n(5.0 percent) were little changed in April.  A year earlier, the number of\nunemployed persons was 6.8 million, and the jobless rate was 4.5 percent. \nOver the month, the unemployment rates for most major worker groups--adult\nmen (4.6 percent), teenagers (15.4 percent), whites (4.4 percent), blacks\n(8.6 percent), and Hispanics (6.9 percent)--showed little or no change.  The\njobless rate for adult women decreased to 4.3 percent in April, nearly off-\nsetting an increase in the prior month.  The unemployment rate for Asians\nwas 3.2 percent (not seasonally adjusted) in April.  (See tables A-1, A-2,\nand A-3.)\n\nTotal Employment and the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   Both total employment, at 146.3 million, and the employment-population\nratio, at 62.7 percent, were little changed in April.  Over the month, the\nlabor force participation rate held at 66.0 percent; it was the same rate a\nyear earlier.  (See table A-1.)\n\n   In April, the number of persons working part time for economic reasons\nincreased by 306,000 to 5.2 million.  This level was 849,000 higher than in\nApril 2007.  These individuals indicated that they were working part time\nbecause their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a\nfull-time job.  (See table A-5.)\n\nPersons Not in the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   About 1.4 million persons (not seasonally adjusted) were marginally attached\nto the labor force in April.  These individuals wanted and were available for\nwork and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months.  They were not\ncounted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks pre-\nceding the survey.  Among the marginally attached, there were 412,000 discouraged\nworkers in April, about the same as a year earlier.  Discouraged workers were not\ncurrently looking for work specifically because they believed no jobs were avail-\nable for them.  The other 1.0 million persons classified as marginally attached\nto the labor force in April cited reasons such as school attendance or family \nresponsibilities.

Since March 2007, the number of unemployed persons has increased by\n1.1 million, and the unemployment rate has risen by 0.7 percentage point.\n(See table A-1.)\n\n   Over the month, unemployment rates rose for adult men (to 4.6 percent),\nadult women (4.6 percent), and Hispanics (6.9 percent).  The jobless rates\nedged up for blacks (to 9.0 percent) and whites (4.5 percent), while the\nrate for teenagers (15.8 percent) was essentially unchanged.  The unemploy-\nment rate for Asians was 3.6 percent, not seasonally adjusted.  (See tables\nA-1, A-2, and A-3.)\n\n   In March, the number of persons unemployed because they lost jobs increased\nby 300,000 to 4.2 million.  Over the past 12 months, the number of unemployed\njob losers has increased by 914,000.  (See table A-8.)\n\nTotal Employment and the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   The civilian labor force rose to 153.8 million over the month, offsetting a\ndecline in the prior month.  The labor force participation rate was 66.0 percent\nin March and has remained at or near that level since last spring.  Total employ-\nment held at 146.0 million.

(See table A-5.)\n\nPersons Not in the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   About 1.4 million persons (not seasonally adjusted) were marginally attached to\nthe labor force in March.  These individuals wanted and were available for work and\nhad looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months.  They were not counted as un-\nemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.\nAmong the marginally attached, there were 401,000 discouraged workers in March, about\nthe same as a year earlier.  Discouraged workers are defined as persons not currently\nlooking for work specifically because they believed no jobs were available for them.\nThe other 951,000 persons classified as marginally attached to the labor force in \nMarch cited reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.

over the month but was up by 637,000 over\nthe past 12 months.  This category includes persons who indicated that they\nwould like to work full time but were working part time because their hours had\nbeen cut back or they were unable to find full-time jobs.  (See table A-5.)\n\nPersons Not in the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   About 1.6 million persons (not seasonally adjusted) were marginally attached\nto the labor force in February.  These individuals wanted and were available for\nwork and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months.  They were not\ncounted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks pre-\nceding the survey.  Among the marginally attached, there were 396,000 discouraged\nworkers in February, about the same as a year earlier.  Discouraged workers were\nnot currently looking for work specifically because they believed no jobs were\navailable for them.  The other 1.2 million persons marginally attached to the\nlabor force in February had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the\nsurvey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.  (See\ntable A-13.)\n\nIndustry Payroll Employment (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   Total nonfarm payroll employment edged down (-63,000) in February, with pri-\nvate-sector employment declining by 101,000.   Nonfarm payroll employment was\nlittle changed in December (41,000) and January (-22,000).  Over the month, job\nlosses occurred in manufacturing, construction, and retail trade.  Health care\nand food services continued to add jobs.  (See table B-1.)\n\n   Manufacturing employment continued to decline in February (-52,000), bringing\nlosses over the past 12 months to 299,000.  Most of the February decline was con-\ncentrated in durable goods manufacturing, as motor vehicles and parts (-13,000),\nfurniture and related products (-6,000), and wood products (-5,000) lost jobs. \nWithin nondurable goods, employment fell in printing and related support activi-\nties (-5,000).\n\n   Employment in construction decreased by 39,000 in February, and has fallen\nby 331,000 since its most recent peak in September 2006.  During this period,\nresidential specialty trades lost 209,000 jobs, while residential building lost\n137,000 jobs.\n\n   In February, employment in retail trade declined by 34,000.  Job losses occur-\nred in department stores (-11,000), building material and garden supply stores\n(-7,000), and automobile dealers (-6,000).  Wholesale trade employment edged down\nin February, with the durable goods component declining by 9,000.\n\n   Professional and business services employment was little changed for the second\nmonth in a row; job gains had averaged 26,000 per month in 2007.  In February, tem-\nporary help services lost 28,000 jobs; employment in the industry has declined by\n117,000 since the most recent peak in December 2006.\n\n   In financial activities, credit intermediation employment continued to decline\nand has fallen by 116,000 since a peak in October 2006.  In February, real estate\nemployment also continued to trend down; since June 2006, the industry has lost\n34,000 jobs.\n\n\n                                   - 3 -\n\n\n   Health care employment continued to grow in February (36,000).  Within health\ncare, over-the-month job gains occurred in hospitals (17,000) and in ambulatory\nhealth care services (15,000), which includes offices of physicians.  Over the\npast 12 months, health care has added 360,000 jobs.\n\n   Food services employment continued to trend upward in February.  From November\nthrough February, food services added an average of 12,000 jobs per month, compared\nwith an average gain of 28,000 jobs for the 12-month period ending in October.\n\nWeekly Hours (Establishment Survey Data)\n\n   In February, the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers on\nprivate nonfarm payrolls held at 33.7 hours, seasonally adjusted.  Both the manu-\nfacturing workweek, at 41.1 hours, and factory overtime, at 4.0 hours, were un-\nchanged over the month.  (See table B-2.)\n\n   The index of aggregate weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory workers\non nonfarm payrolls declined by 0.1 percent in February to 107.3 (2002=100).  The\nmanufacturing index fell by 0.5 percent to 93.1.

This followed gains of 6 cents in December and 5 cents in January.\nAverage weekly earnings rose by 0.3 percent in February to $599.86.  Over the past\n12 months, both average hourly earnings and weekly earnings rose by 3.7 percent.\n(See table B-3.)\n\n                     ______________________________\n\n   The Employment Situation for March 2008 is scheduled to be released on \nFriday, April 4, at 8:30 A.M.

The small January move-\nment in nonfarm payroll employment (-17,000) reflected declines in construction\nand manufacturing and job growth in health care.  Average hourly earnings rose\nby 4 cents, or 0.2 percent, over the month.\n\nUnemployment (Household Survey Data)\n\n   The number of unemployed persons (7.6 million) and the unemployment rate \n(4.9 percent) were essentially unchanged in January.  Over the month, the unem-\nployment rates for all major worker groups--adult men (4.4 percent), adult women\n(4.2 percent), teenagers (18.0 percent), whites (4.4 percent), blacks (9.2 per-\ncent), and Hispanics (6.3 percent)--showed little or no change.  The unemployment\nrate for Asians was 3.2 percent, not seasonally adjusted.  (See tables A-1, A-2,\nand A-3.)\n\nTotal Employment and the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   Total employment and the employment-population ratio edged up in January after\naccounting for the annual adjustment to the population controls.  The civilian\nlabor force also rose when adjustment is made to account for the effect of pop-\nulation control changes.  The labor force participation rate (66.1 percent) was\nabout the same as in December.  (See tables A-1 and D.)\n\nPersons Not in the Labor Force (Household Survey Data)\n\n   About 1.7 million persons (not seasonally adjusted) were marginally attached to\nthe labor force in January, up from about 1.6 million a year earlier.  These indivi-\nduals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the\nprior 12 months.  They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched\nfor work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  Among the marginally attached, there\nwere 467,000 discouraged workers in January, about the same as a year earlier.  Dis-\ncouraged workers were not currently looking for work specifically because they be-\nlieved no jobs were available for them.  The other 1.3 million persons marginally\nattached to the labor force in January had not searched for work in the 4 weeks pre-\nceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.\n(See table A-13.)\n\n   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   |                                                                           |\n   |                      Establishment and Household Data Changes             |\n   |                                                                           |\n   |   The establishment survey data in this release have been revised as a    |\n   |result of the annual benchmarking process, the updating of seasonal adjust-|\n   |ment factors, and the updating to NAICS 2007 from NAICS 2002.

These counts are derived principally from unemployment insur-   |\n  |ance tax records for March 2007.  In addition, establishment survey data     |\n  |were updated to the 2007 North American Industry Classification System       |\n  |(NAICS) from the 2002 NAICS basis; this resulted in minor changes to sever-  |\n  |al detailed industry series.  Not seasonally adjusted data series affected  |\n  |by the NAICS 2007 update were subject to revision from January 1990 forward. |\n  |All other not seasonally adjusted data series were subject to revision from  |\n  |April 2006 forward, the time period since the last benchmark was established.|\n  |In addition, with this release, the seasonally adjusted establishment survey |\n  |data from January 1990 forward were subject to revision due to the introduc- |\n  |tion of updated seasonal adjustment factors and NAICS 2007 updates.          |\n  |                                                                             |\n  |   Table B presents revised total nonfarm employment data on a seasonally ad-|\n  |justed basis for January through December 2007.  The revised data for April  |\n  |2007 forward incorporate the effect of applying the rate of change measured  |\n  |by the sample to the new benchmark level, as well as updated net business    |\n  |birth/death model adjustments and new seasonal adjustment factors.  The      |\n  |November and December 2007 revisions also reflect the routine  incorporation |\n  |of additional sample receipts into the November final and December second    |\n  |preliminary estimates.  The total nonfarm employment level for March 2007 was|\n  |revised downward by 293,000 (284,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis).

Population controls for the household    |\n  |survey are developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.  Each year, the Census       |\n  |Bureau updates the controls to reflect new information and assumptions about |\n  |the growth of the population during the decade.  The change in population    |\n  |reflected in the new controls results primarily from adjustments to the es-  |\n  |timates of net international migration and the institutional population,     |\n  |along with updated vital statistics information.                             |\n  |                                                                             |\n  |   As per usual practice, BLS will not revise the official household survey  |\n  |estimates for December 2007 and earlier months.  To show the impact of the   |\n  |updated population controls, however, some December 2007 estimates were re-  |\n  |calculated using the new controls.  The differences in selected December     |\n  |estimates based on the old and new controls are shown in table C.  The new   |\n  |controls decreased the estimated size of the civilian noninstitutional popu- |\n  |lation in December by 745,000, the civilian labor force by 637,000, and em-  |\n  |ployment by 598,000; the new population controls had a negligible impact on  |\n  |unemployment rates and other percentage estimates.  Table D shows the effect |\n  |of the introduction of new population controls on the over-the-month changes |\n  |between December 2007 and January 2008.  More detailed information on the    |\n  |population adjustments and their effect on national labor force estimates are|\n  |available at http://www.bls.gov/cps/cps08adj.pdf on the Internet.            |\n  |                                                                             |\n  |                                                                             |\n  |                                                                             |\n  |                                                                             |\n  |Table C.
