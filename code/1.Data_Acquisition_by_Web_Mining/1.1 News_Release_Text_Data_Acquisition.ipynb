    "In the first part set up a process to automatically scrape and collect news release texts from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) website. This process is structured into several key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Web Browser Automation**: Using Selenium and Chrome WebDriver, I configure the browser to mimic real user behavior by randomly selecting user agents. This helps in accessing the website without being blocked by potential security measures against bots.\n",
    "2. **Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup**: Once the page is loaded, BeautifulSoup parses the HTML content to extract relevant links to news releases, specifically focusing on employment statistics (identified by specific URL patterns).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Collection and Storage**: Each link's text and corresponding URL are stored in a JSON file, ensuring that I have a structured dataset of URLs pointing to individual news releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Further Content Scraping**: In the second script, I revisit the stored URLs to extract the full text content of each news release. This involves opening each URL, loading the content, and then parsing it to extract the text, which is then saved alongside its respective date.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Error Handling and Data Integrity**: I implemented basic error handling during date extraction and ensured that each text content is associated with its correct release date. If the content cannot be found or the date cannot be parsed, this is also logged, ensuring transparency in my data collection process."
